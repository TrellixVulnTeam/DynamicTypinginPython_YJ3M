+# Security Notice
+
+Dependencies in the Docker images are frozen on release, and can’t be updated in
+situ. This means that we necessarily capture any bugs or security issues that
+may be present. We don’t generally release new Docker images simply to update
+dependencies (though we may do so if we become aware of a really serious issue).
