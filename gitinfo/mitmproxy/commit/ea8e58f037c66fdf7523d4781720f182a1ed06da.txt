+Ubuntu comes with Python but we need to install pip, python-dev and several libraries.  This was tested on a fully patched installation of Ubuntu 14.04.
 
-The easiest way to get up and running on OSX is to download the pre-built binary packages from [mitmproxy.org](http://mitmproxy.org). If you still want to install using pip, there are a few things to keep in mind:
+<pre class="terminal">
+$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
 
-- If you're running a Python interpreter installed with homebrew (or similar), you may have to install some dependencies by hand. 
-- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).
+$ sudo pip install mitmproxy
+</pre>
+
+Once installation is complete you can run <a href="mitmproxy.html">mitmproxy</a> or <a href="mitmdump.html">mitmdump</a> from a terminal.
+
+### Installation From Source
+
+If you would like to install mitmproxy directly from the master branch on GitHub or would like to get set up to contribute to the project, install the dependencies with apt:
+
+<pre class="terminal">
+$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
+</pre>
+
+Then see the <a href="https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/README.mkd#hacking">Hacking</a> section of the README on GitHub.

 There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy comfortable to use on OSX. The default color scheme is optimized for a dark background terminal, but you can select a palette for a light terminal background with the --palette option. You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program to create a simple and effective <b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view request and response bodies:
