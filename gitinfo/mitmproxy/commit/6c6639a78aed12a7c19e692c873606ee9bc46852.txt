 Quick Setup
 -----------
 
-By far the easiest way to install the mitmproxy certificates is to use the built-in
-web app. To do this, start mitmproxy and configure your target device with the
-correct proxy settings. Now start a browser on the device, and visit the domain **mitm.it**.

+Installing the mitmproxy CA Certificate Manually
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Most of the time you can easily install mitmproxy's CA certificate through the webapp, and just follow the prompts.  In a couple of situations, such as Java or the iOS Simulator, there aren't any obvious ways to install the CA certificate.

 More On mitmproxy Certificates
 ------------------------------
 
-The first time __mitmproxy__ or __mitmdump__ is run, the mitmproxy Certificate 
-Authority(CA) is created in the config directory (~/.mitmproxy by default).
-This CA is used for on-the-fly generation of dummy certificates for each of the 
-SSL sites that your client visits. Since your browser won't trust the
-__mitmproxy__ CA out of the box , you will see an SSL certificate
-warning every time you visit a new SSL domain through __mitmproxy__. When
-you are testing a single site through a browser, just accepting the bogus SSL
-cert manually is not too much trouble, but there are a many circumstances where
-you will want to configure your testing system or browser to trust the
-__mitmproxy__ CA as a signing root authority.
