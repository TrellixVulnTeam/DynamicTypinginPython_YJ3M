-Netlib is a collection of network utility classes, used by pathod and mitmproxy
-projects. It differs from other projects in some fundamental respects, because
-both pathod and mitmproxy often need to violate standards. This means that
-protocols are implemented as small, well-contained and flexible functions, and
-servers are implemented to allow misbehaviour when needed.

-At this point, I have no plans to make netlib useful beyond mitmproxy and
-pathod. Please get in touch if you think parts of netlib might have broader
-utility.
