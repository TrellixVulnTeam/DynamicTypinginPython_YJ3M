-# Release policies
-
-  - By default, every release is a new minor (`0.x`) release and it will be
-    pushed for all three projects.
-
-  - Only if an emergency bugfix is needed, we push a new `0.x.y` bugfix release
-    for a single project. This matches with what we do in `setup.py`:
-
-        "mitmproxy>=%s, <%s" % (version.MINORVERSION, version.NEXT_MINORVERSION)
