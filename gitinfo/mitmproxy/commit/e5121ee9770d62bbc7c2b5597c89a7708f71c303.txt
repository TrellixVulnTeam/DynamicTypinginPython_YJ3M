    Update howto-transparent.md
    
    i got a syntax error on macOS high sierra with the existing example pf.conf line. based on sample pf rules i found online, i believe it was missing the `pass` keyword, which i added.
    
    also, the surrounding text refers to "two lines," when there is only one, so i've updated that too.
