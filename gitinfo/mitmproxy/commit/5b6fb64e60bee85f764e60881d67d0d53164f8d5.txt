 ## Installing from source
 
-The preferred way to install mitmproxy - whether you're installing the latest release or from source - is to use [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/). If you don't already have pip on your system, you can find installation instructions [here](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

 ## OSX
 
-The easiest way to get up and running on OSX is to download the pre-built
-binary packages from [mitmproxy.org](http://mitmproxy.org). If you still want
-to install using pip, there are a few things to keep in mind:
-
-- If you're running a Python interpreter installed with homebrew (or similar),
-you may have to install some dependencies by hand. 
-- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the
-command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).
-
-There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy
-comfortable to use on OSX. The default color scheme is optimized for a dark
-background terminal, but you can select a palette for a light terminal
-background with the --palette option. You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program
-to create a simple and effective <b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view request and
-response bodies:
