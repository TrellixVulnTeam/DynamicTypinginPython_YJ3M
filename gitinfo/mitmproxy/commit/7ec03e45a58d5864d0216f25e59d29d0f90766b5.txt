 Features:
 
-    - Support for content encodings. At the moment, we sidestep this by
-    stripping headers that indicate accepted encodings. In theory, this should
-    force servers to serve us content uncompressed, but that's not always the

-    direct support for deflate and gzip is the way to go.
     - Add some "workspace" features to mitmproxy:
