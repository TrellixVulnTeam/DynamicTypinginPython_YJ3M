+20 February 2012: mitmproxy 0.7:
+
+    * New built-in key/value editor. This lets you interactively edit URL query
+      strings, headers and URL-encoded form data. 
+
+    * Extend script API to allow duplication and replay of flows.
+    
+    * Add "D" shortcut in mitmproxy to duplicate a flow.
+    
+    * Reverse proxy mode. In this mode mitmproxy acts as an HTTP server,
+      forwarding all traffic to a specified upstream server.
+
+    * UI improvements - use unicode characters to make GUI more compact,
+      improve spacing and layout throughout.
+
+    * Add support for filtering by HTTP method.
+   
+    * Add the ability to specify an HTTP body size limit.
+    
+    * Move to typed netstrings for serialization format - this makes 0.7
+      backwards-incompatible with serialized data from 0.6!
+
+    * Many minor bugfixes and improvements.

-Features:
+Targeted for 0.8:
+    - Upstream proxy support.
+    - Improve worst-case performance problem with XML-ish indenter
+    - Follow mode to keep most recent flow in view
+    - Rewrite the core to be asynchronous. I've done some research, and
+    although it's a bit of a bloated monster, it looks like Twisted is the way
+    to go.
+    - Verbose view to show timestamps
+    - Search within requests/responses
+    - Transparent proxy support
+    - Ordering a-la mutt's "o" shortcut
+
 
+Further ideas:
     - Add some "workspace" features to mitmproxy:
         - Flow comments
         - Copying/duplicating flows
         - Ordering by time, size, etc. a-la-mutt (o keyboard shorcut is reserved for this)
-    - Upstream proxy support.
     - Support HTTP Digest authentication through the stickyauth option. We'll
-    have to save the server nonce, and recalculate the hashes for each request.
