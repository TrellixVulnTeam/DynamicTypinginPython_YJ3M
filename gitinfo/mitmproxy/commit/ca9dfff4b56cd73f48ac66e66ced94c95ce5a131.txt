    improve docs for win install
    
    Adding Python to PATH during installation is useful,
    but doesn't help users who have already installed Python.
    The Powershell command takes care of the Scripts directory
    as well.

-Install the latest version of Python 2 from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python website</a>.  The Windows MSI installer is fairly straightforward and even includes pip as long as you are installing a version of Python 2 after 2.7.9.  For the most part, you can accept the defaults but one option you should change during installation is "Add python.exe to Path".  This will make it easier to run Python.

+First, install the latest version of Python 2.7 from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python website</a>.
+If you already have an older version of Python 2.7 installed, make sure to install <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html">pip</a>
+(pip is included in Python 2.7.9+ by default).
+
+Next, add Python and the Python Scripts directory to your <strong>PATH</strong> variable. You can do this easily by running the following in powershell:
 
 <pre class="terminal">
-C:\> set PATH = C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;%PATH%
+[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")
+</pre>
+
 
-C:\> pip install mitmproxy
+Now, you can install mitmproxy by running
+
+<pre class="terminal">
+pip install mitmproxy
 </pre>
 
-Once installation is complete you can run <a href="mitmdump.html">mitmdump</a> from a Command Prompt.
