    Change error into awesome user-friendlyness
    
    Hi there,
    
    I was getting a very weird error "ODict valuelist should be lists", when attempting to add a header.
    
    My code was as followed:
    
    ```
            msg.headers["API-Key"] = new_headers["API-Key"]
     42         msg.headers["API-Sign"] = new_headers["API-Sign"]
    ```
    
    In the end, that was because there could be multiple equal headers. In order to cater to that, it you guys might enjoy the patch I attach, for it converts strings automatically into lists of multiple headers.
    
    I think it should work, but I haven't tested it :$
    
    It'd allow me to have the above code, instead of this one below:
    
    ```
            msg.headers["API-Key"] = [new_headers["API-Key"]]
     42         msg.headers["API-Sign"] = [new_headers["API-Sign"]]
    ```
