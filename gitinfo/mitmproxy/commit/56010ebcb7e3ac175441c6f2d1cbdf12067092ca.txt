 ## Self-contained Pre-built Binary Packages
 
-For some platforms we provide pre-built binary packages containing
-ready-to-run executables. This includes a self-contained Python 3
-environment, a recent OpenSSL that support ALPN and HTTP/2, and other
-dependencies that would otherwise we cumbersome to compile and install.
-
-Please be advised that we do not update these binaries after the initial
-release. This means we do not include security-related updates of our
-dependencies in already released mitmproxy versions. If there is a
-severe issue, we might consider releasing a bugfix release of mitmproxy
-and corresponding binary packages.
-
-We only support the latest version of mitmproxy with bugfix and security
-updates through regular minor releases.

+dependencies (though we may do so if we become aware of a really serious issue).
+If you use our binary packages, please make sure you update regularly to ensure
