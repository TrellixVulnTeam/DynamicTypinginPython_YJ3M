    Move the admonision to use Discourse in the issue template to the bottom
    
    Github integrations get the raw issue text, which means that the context we see
    in-channel is mostly the admonition. I think it's visible enough at the bottom
    to catch most users who would have paid attention to it if it were at the top.
