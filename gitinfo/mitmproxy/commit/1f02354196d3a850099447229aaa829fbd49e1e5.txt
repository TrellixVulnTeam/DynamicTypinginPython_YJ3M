+17 May 2018: mitmproxy 4.0
+
+  ** Features **
+    * mitmproxy now requires Python 3.6!
+    * Moved the core to asyncio - which gives us a very significant performance boost!
+    * Reduce memory consumption by using `SO_KEEPALIVE` (#3076)
+    * Export request as httpie command (#3031)
+    * Configure mitmproxy console keybindings with the keys.yaml file. See docs for more.
+
+  ** Breaking Changes **
+    * `allow_remote` got replaced by `block_global` and `block_private` (#3100)
+    * No more custom events (#3093)
+    * The `cadir` option has been renamed to `confdir`
+    * We no longer magically capture print statements in addons and translate
+    them to logs. Please use `ctx.log.info` explicitly.
+
+  ** Bugfixes **
+    * Correctly block connections from remote clients with IPv4-mapped IPv6 client addresses (#3099)
+    * Expand `~` in paths during the `cut` command (#3078)
+    * Remove socket listen backlog constraint
+    * Improve handling of user script exceptions (#3050)
+    * Ignore signal errors on windows
+    * And lots of typos, docs improvements, revamped examples, and general fixes!
+
 05 April 2018: mitmproxy 3.0.4
 
   * Fix an issue that caused mitmproxy to not retry HTTP requests on timeout.
