+# Getting Started
+
+You have already [installed]({{< relref "overview-installation">}}) mitmproxy on
+your machine.
+
+# Launch the tool you need
+
+You can start any of our three tools from the command line / terminal:
+
+  * [mitmproxy]({{< relref "tools-mitmproxy">}}) -> gives you an interactive TUI
+  * [mitmdump]({{< relref "tools-mitmdump">}}) -> gives you a plain and simple terminal output
+  * [mitmweb]({{< relref "tools-mitmweb">}}) -> gives you a browser-based GUI
+
+When we talk about "mitmproxy" we usually refer to any of the three tools - they
+are just different front-ends to the same core proxy.
+
+# Configure your browser or device
+
+For the basic setup as [regular proxy]({{< relref
+"concepts-modes#regular-proxy">}}), you need to configure your browser or device
+to route all web traffic through mitmproxy as HTTP proxy. Browser versions and
+configurations options frequently change, so we recommend to simply search the
+web on how to configure an HTTP proxy for your system. Some operating system
+have a global settings, some browser have their own, other applications use
+environment variables, etc.
+
+You can check that your web traffic is going through mitmproxy by browsing to
+http://mitm.it - it should present you with a [simple page]({{< relref
+"concepts-certificates/#quick-setup">}}) to install the mitmproxy Certificate
+Authority - which is also the next steps. Follow the instructions for your OS /
+system and install the CA (and make sure to enable it, some system require
+multiple steps!).
+
+# Verifying everything works
+
+At this point your running mitmproxy instance should already show the first HTTP
+flows from your client. You can test that all TLS-encrypted web traffic is
+working as expected by browsing to https://mitmproxy.org - it should show up as
+new flow and you can inspect it.
+
+Done.
