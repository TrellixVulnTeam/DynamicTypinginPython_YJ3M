+The recommended way to install mitmproxy on Linux is to download our

-Our pre-built binaries provide you with the latest version of mitmproxy, a
-self-contained Python 3.5 environment and a recent version of OpenSSL that
-supports HTTP/2. Of course, you can also install mitmproxy from source if you
-prefer that (see :ref:`install-advanced`).
+Some Linux distributions and their community provide mitmproxy packages via
+their native package repositories (e.g., Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux,
+OpenSUSE, etc.). While we do encourage seeing mitmproxy in a great variety of
+repositories and distributions, we are not maintaining or involved with their
+downstream packaging efforts. If you are looking for the latest version or have
+other problems, please contact the repository maintainers directly.

+---------------------
 
-mitmproxy has been added into the [community] repository. Use pacman to install it:
+.. _binary-packages:
 
->>> sudo pacman -S mitmproxy
+Self-contained Pre-built Binary Packages
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
+For some platforms we provide pre-built binary packages containing ready-to-run
+executables. This includes a self-contained Python 3 environment, a recent
+OpenSSL that support ALPN and HTTP/2, and other dependencies that would
+otherwise we cumbersome to compile and install.
 
-.. _install-source-ubuntu:
+Please be advised that we do not updates these binaries after the initial
+release. This means we do not include security-related updates of our
+dependencies in already released mitmproxy versions. If there is a severe issue,
+we might consider releasing a bugfix release of mitmproxy and corresponding
+binary packages.
 
-Installation from Source on Ubuntu
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+We only support the latest version of mitmproxy with bugfix and security updates
+through regular minor releases.
 
-Ubuntu comes with Python but we need to install pip3, python3-dev and several
-libraries. This was tested on a fully patched installation of Ubuntu 16.04.
 
-.. code:: bash
+.. _install-docker:
 
-   sudo apt-get install python3-pip
-   sudo pip3 install mitmproxy
+Docker Images
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
-On older Ubuntu versions, e.g., **12.04** and **14.04**, you may need to install
-a newer version of Python. mitmproxy requires Python 3.5 or higher. Please take
-a look at pyenv_. Make sure to have an up-to-date version of pip by running
-``pip3 install -U pip``.
+You can use the official mitmproxy images from `DockerHub`_. The same security
+considerations apply as for our binary packages.

+Installation on Linux via pip3
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
-Fedora comes with Python but we need to install pip3, python3-dev and several
-libraries. This was tested on a fully patched installation of Fedora 24.
+Please make sure to install Python 3.5 (or higher) and pip3 for your
+distribtion. If your distribution does not provide a suitable Python version,
+you can use `pyenv`_ to get a recent Python environment.
 
 .. code:: bash
 
-   sudo dnf install python3-pip
-   sudo pip3 install mitmproxy
-
-Make sure to have an up-to-date version of pip by running ``pip3 install -U pip``.
+    sudo apt install python3-pip # Debian 8 or higher, Ubuntu 16.04 or higher

-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+    sudo pip3 install -U pip
 
-This was tested on a fully patched installation of openSUSE Tumbleweed.
-Please note that openSUSE Leap 42.2 only comes with Python 3.4.x, whereas mitmproxy requires Python 3.5 or above.
-You can check you Python version by running ``python3 --version``.
+Now you can install mitmproxy via pip3:
