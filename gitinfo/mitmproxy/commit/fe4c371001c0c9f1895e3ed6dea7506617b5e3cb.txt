-# Overview
-
-You should think of the mitmproxy project's tools as a set of front-ends that
-expose the same underlying functionality. We aim to have feature parity across
-all of our tooling, and all tools share a common configuration mechanism and
-most command-line options.

-**mitmproxy** is a console tool that allows interactive examination and
-modification of HTTP traffic. It differs from mitmdump in that all flows are
-kept in memory, which means that it's intended for taking and manipulating
-small-ish samples. Use the `?` shortcut key to view, context-sensitive
-documentation from any **mitmproxy** screen.

-Mitmweb is currently in beta. We consider it stable for all features
-currently exposed in the UI, but it still misses a lot of mitmproxy's
-features.
