+The mitmproxy certificate authority
+-----------------------------------
 
 The first time **mitmproxy** or **mitmdump** is run, the mitmproxy Certificate
 Authority (CA) is created in the config directory (``~/.mitmproxy`` by default).
 This CA is used for on-the-fly generation of dummy certificates for each of the
 SSL sites that your client visits. Since your browser won't trust the
-mitmproxy CA out of the box , you will see an SSL certificate warning every

 time you visit a new SSL domain through mitmproxy. When you are testing a
 single site through a browser, just accepting the bogus SSL cert manually is
 not too much trouble, but there are a many circumstances where you will want to
 configure your testing system or browser to trust the mitmproxy CA as a
-signing root authority. For security reasons, the mitmproxy CA is generated uniquely on the first
-start and is not shared between mitmproxy installations on different devices.

+Certificate Pinning
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+Some applications employ `Certificate Pinning`_ to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
 This means that **mitmproxy** and **mitmdump's** certificates will not be
-accepted by these applications. This is because when an application pins a
-certificate it requires that SSL traffic is encrypted with a specific
-certificate rather than any certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate
-Authority (CA). In order to work around this, it is recommended to use the 
-`Ignore Domains <http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/features/passthrough.html#ignore-domains>`_
-feature in order to prevent **mitmproxy** and **mitmdump** from intercepting
-traffic to these specific domains.
