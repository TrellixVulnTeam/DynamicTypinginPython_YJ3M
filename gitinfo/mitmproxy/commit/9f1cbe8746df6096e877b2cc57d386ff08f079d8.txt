     * All mitmproxy tools are now Python 3 only! We plan to support Python 3.5 and higher.
 
+    * Web-Based User Interface: Mitmproxy now offically has a web-based user interface
+      called mitmweb. We consider it stable for all features currently exposed 
+      in the UI, but it still misses a lot of mitmproxyâ€™s options.
+      
+    * Windows Compatibility: With mitmweb, mitmproxy is now useable on Windows. 
+      We are also introducing an installer (kindly sponsored by BitRock) that 
+      simplifies setup.
+      
     * Configuration: The config file format is now a single YAML file. In most cases,
       converting to the new format should be trivial - please see the docs for
       more information.
