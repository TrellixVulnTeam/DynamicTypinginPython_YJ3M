    docs: don't set accept_redirects.
    
    it's not really clear why we are even doing this,
    so let's just remove it entirely and see what happens.

  3. If your target machine is on the same physical network and you configured it to use a custom
     gateway, disable ICMP redirects:
 
-    >>> sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
-    >>> sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
     >>> sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
 
     You may also want to consider enabling this permanently in ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` or a newly created ``/etc/sysctl.d/mitmproxy.conf``, see `here <https://superuser.com/a/625852>`__.
