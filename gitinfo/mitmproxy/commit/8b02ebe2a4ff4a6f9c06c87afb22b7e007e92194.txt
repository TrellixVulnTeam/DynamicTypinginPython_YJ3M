-Pathod is a pathological HTTP/S server, used for testing and stressing
-unsuspecting client software.
+**pathod** is a pathological HTTP/S daemon, useful for testing and torturing
+HTTP clients. At **pathod**'s heart is a tiny, terse language for crafting HTTP
+responses. The simplest way to use **pathod** is to fire up the daemon, and
+specify the response behaviour you want using this language in the request URL.
+Here's a minimal example:
 
+    http://localhost:9999/p/200
+
+Everything after the "/p/" path component is a response specifier - in this
+case just a vanilla 200 OK response. See the complete docs to get (much)
+fancier. You can also add anchors to the **pathod** server that serve a fixed
+response whenever a matching URL is requested:
+
+    pathod --anchor "/foo=200"
+
+Here, "/foo" a regex specifying the anchor path, and the part after the "=" is
+a response specifier.
+
+**pathod** also has a nifty built-in web interface, which lets you play with
+the language by previewing responses, exposes activity logs, online help and
+various other goodies. Try it by visiting the server root:
+
+    http://localhost:9999
