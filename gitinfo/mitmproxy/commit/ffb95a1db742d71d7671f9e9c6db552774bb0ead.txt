+### Host Header
+
+In reverse proxy mode, mitmproxy does not rewrite the host header. While often useful, this
+may lead to issues with public web servers. For example, consider the following scenario:
+
+    $ python mitmdump -d -R http://example.com/ &
+    $ curl http://localhost:8080/
+
+    >> GET https://example.com/
+        Host: localhost:8080
+        User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
+        [...]
+
+    << 404 Not Found 345B
+
+Since the Host header doesn't match <samp>example.com</samp>, an error is returned.<br>
+There are two ways to solve this:
+<ol>
+    <li>Modify the hosts file of your OS so that example.com resolves to 127.0.0.1.</li>
+    <li>
+        Instruct mitmproxy to rewrite the host header by passing <kbd>&#8209;&#8209;setheader&nbsp;:~q:Host:example.com</kbd>.
+        However, keep in mind that absolute URLs within the returned document or HTTP redirects will cause the client application
+        to bypass the proxy.
+    </li>
+</ol>
