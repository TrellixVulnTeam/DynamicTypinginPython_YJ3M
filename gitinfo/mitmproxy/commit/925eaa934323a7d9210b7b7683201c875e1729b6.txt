+Note that the **rdr** rules in the pf.conf given above only apply to inbound
+traffic. This means that they will NOT redirect traffic coming from the box
+running pf itself. We can't distinguish between an outbound connection from a
+non-mitmproxy app, and an outbound connection from mitmproxy itself - if you
+want to intercept your OSX traffic, you should use an external host to run
+mitmproxy. None the less, pf is flexible to cater for a range of creative
+possibilities, like intercepting traffic emanating from VMs.  See the
+**pf.conf** man page for more.
