    Accurately timestamp start of request
    
    When building a request from a stream, try to get an accurate
    start timestamp from the Reader. This was already in the code
    and also used when building response objects, but was ommited
    in commit ddf458b330bf9fe200cb1dbc3ddb5ae1a5d2102a
    
    Without his logic and when the client is reusing a connection
    to send requests, the timestamp_start of subsequent requests
    is early and equal to when the connection started read blocking
