+Some applications pin their SSL certificates in order to prevent MITM attacks.
+This means that **mitmproxy** and **mitmdump's** certificates will not be
+accepted by these applications. This is because when an application pins a

+certificate rather than any certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate
+Authority (CA). In order to work around this, it is recommended to use the

+traffic to these specific domains.
