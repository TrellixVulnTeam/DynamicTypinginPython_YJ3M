 # Release Checklist
 
-Make sure to run all these steps on the correct branch you want to create a new
-release for! The command examples assume that you have a git remote called
-`upstream` that points to the `mitmproxy/mitmproxy` repo.
+These steps assume you are on the correct branch and have a git remote called `origin` that points to the `mitmproxy/mitmproxy` repo. If necessary, create a major version branch starting off the release tag (e.g. `git checkout -b v4.x v4.0.0`) first.
 
-- Verify that `mitmproxy/version.py` is correct.
 - Update CHANGELOG.
 - Verify that all CI tests pass.
-- If needed, create a major version branch - e.g. `v4.x`. Assuming you have a remote repo called `upstream` that points to the mitmproxy/mitmproxy repo::
-  - `git checkout -b v4.x upstream/master`
-  - `git push -u upstream v4.x`
+- Verify that `mitmproxy/version.py` is correct. Remove `.dev` suffix if it exists.
 - Tag the release and push to Github.
     - `git tag v4.0.0`
-    - `git push upstream v4.0.0`
+    - `git push origin v4.0.0`
 - Wait for tag CI to complete.
