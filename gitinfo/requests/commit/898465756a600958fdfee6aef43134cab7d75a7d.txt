+Note: Custom headers are given less precedence than more specific sources of information. For instance:
+
+* Authorization headers will be overridden by any alternative auth source found.
+* Authorization headers will be removed if you get redirected off-host.
+* Proxy-Authorization headers will be overridden by proxy credentials provided in the URL.
+* Content-Length headers will be overridden when we can determine the length of the content.
+
+Furthermore, Requests does not change its behavior at all based on which custom headers are specified. The headers are simply passed on into the final request.
