 Feature Overview
 ================
 
+Requests is designed to solve a 90% use case â€” making simple requests. While most
+HTTP libraries are extremely extensible, they often attempt to support the entire HTTP Spec.
+This often leads to extremely messy and cumbersome APIs, as is the case with urllib2. Requests abandons support for edge-cases, and focuses on the essentials.
