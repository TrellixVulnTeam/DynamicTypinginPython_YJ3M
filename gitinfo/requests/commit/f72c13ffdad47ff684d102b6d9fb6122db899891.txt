    Accept unusual keys in cookies.
    
    The Oreos module throws CookieErrors when it catches keys that have
    characters that shouldn't be in them, like colons and braces. Other
    services are happy to send out such keys, however. This commit makes
    requests non-standards compliant, just like everyone else is.
