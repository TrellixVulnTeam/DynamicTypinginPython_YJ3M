+**Improvements**
 
+- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
+  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
+  variable.
+- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
+  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
+  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
 - The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
   ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
   ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly

 - Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
   check doesn't use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
 
+**Bugfixes**
+
+- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
+  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeError``s are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
+  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
+- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
+  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
+- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
+  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
+- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning``s on Python 3.6.
+- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I'm sure
+  this is what you were all worrying about most.
