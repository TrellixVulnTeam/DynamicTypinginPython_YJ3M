    Ensure that .raw() is present after unpickling.
    
    Some people will assume that .raw() is present, and they shouldn't get
    AttributeErrors when they make that assumption on a pickled Response.
    However, @kennethreitz has asked that we not be too dependent on
    urllib3. For that reason, set to None.
