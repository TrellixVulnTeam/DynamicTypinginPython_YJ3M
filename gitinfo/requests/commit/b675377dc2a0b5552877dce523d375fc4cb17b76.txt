 Requests' simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For
 example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request::
 
-    >>> r = requests.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
+    >>> r = requests.post("http://httpbin.org/post", data = {"key":"value"})
 
 Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD and
 OPTIONS? These are all just as simple::
 
-    >>> r = requests.put("http://httpbin.org/put")
+    >>> r = requests.put("http://httpbin.org/put", data = {"key":"value"})
     >>> r = requests.delete("http://httpbin.org/delete")
     >>> r = requests.head("http://httpbin.org/get")
     >>> r = requests.options("http://httpbin.org/get")
