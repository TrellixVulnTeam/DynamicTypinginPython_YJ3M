-*Warning: Recreational use of the Python standard library for HTTP may result in dangerous side-effects,
-including: security vulnerabilities, verbose code, reinventing the wheel,
-constantly reading documentation, depression, headaches, or even death.*
+.. warning:: The use of Python 3 is highly preferred over Python 2. Please consider upgrading your applications and infrastructure, if you find yourself *still* using Python 2 in production. If you are using Python 3, congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste.*
