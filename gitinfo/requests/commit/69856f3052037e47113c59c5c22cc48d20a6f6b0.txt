 **Requests** is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
 consumption.
 
-.. note:: The use of **Python 3** is *highly* preferred over Python 2. Consider upgrading your applications and infrastructure if you find yourself *still* using Python 2 in production today. If you are using Python 3, congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste.

+.. note:: **Requests 2.x** is officially in *maintinence-mode only*. This means we only respond to CVE-level tickets. All of our limited available attention / energy is being allocated towards the development of `Requests III <https://3.python-requests.org/>`_. Your involvement / support is appreciated! Please see `this page <https://kennethreitz.org/requests3> for more details.`.
