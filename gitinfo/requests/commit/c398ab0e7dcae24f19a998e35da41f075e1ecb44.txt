+**Bugfixes**
+
+- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with "http".
+  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
+  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
+  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
+  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
+  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
