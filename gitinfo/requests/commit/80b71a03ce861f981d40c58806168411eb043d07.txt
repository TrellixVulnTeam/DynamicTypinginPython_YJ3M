-Welcome to Requests's documentation!
-====================================
+Requests: Python HTTP (That Doesn't Suck)!
+==========================================
+
+Release |version|.
+
+Requests is an :ref:`ISC Licensed <usc>` HTTP library, written in Python.
+
+Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are insane. This one strives to focus on the 95% use case: Simply sending the requests.
+
+GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE.
+
+
+How Simple?
+-----------
+
+
+requests
+~~~~~~~~
+
+::
+
+    import requests
+    requests.get('https://convore.com/api', auth=('username', 'password'))
+
+
+urllib2
+~~~~~~~
+
+::
+
+    # complicated.
+
+
+I recommend you start with :ref:`Installation <install>`.
