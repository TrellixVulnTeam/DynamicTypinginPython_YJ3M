    Add a bit more to the developer's documentation
    
    I'm not sure what else could be added to satisfy #601. If this is sufficient,
    I suggest closing that.

+Versions of Python to Test On
+-----------------------------
+
+Officially (as of 26-Nov-2012), requests supports python 2.6-3.3. In the 
+future, support for 3.1 and 3.2 may be dropped. In general you will need to 
+test on at least one python 2 and one python 3 version. You can also set up 
+Travis CI for your own fork before you submit a pull request so that you are 
+assured your fork works. To use Travis CI for your fork and other projects see 
+their `documentation <http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/>`_.
