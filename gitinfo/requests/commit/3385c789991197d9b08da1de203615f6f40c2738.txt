 **Bugfixes**
 
-- Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie without a host
-  value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL exposing requests
-  users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie stealing. This was
-  disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of `BugFuzz <https://bugfuzz.com>`_.
-  An CVE identifier has not yet been assigned for this. This affects all
-  versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).
