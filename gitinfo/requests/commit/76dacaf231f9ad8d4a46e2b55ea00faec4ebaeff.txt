 Requests is an :ref:`ISC Licensed <isc>` HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.

-Requests allows you to send  **HEAD**, **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**,
-**PATCH**, and **DELETE** HTTP requests. You can add headers, form data,
-multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
-response data in the same way. It's powered by :py:class:`httplib` and :py:class:`urllib3`, and it strives to be as elegant and approachable as possible.
+Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP — making your integration with web services seamless. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data.
