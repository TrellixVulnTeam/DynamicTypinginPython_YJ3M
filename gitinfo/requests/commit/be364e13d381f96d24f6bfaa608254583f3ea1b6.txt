-OAuth Authentication
+Other Authentication
 --------------------
 
-Requests features robust, built-in OAuth support!
+Requests is designed to allow other forms of authentication to be easily and
+quickly plugged in. Members of the open-source community frequently write
+authentication handlers for more complicated or less commonly-used forms of
+authentication. Some of the best have been brought together under a single
+`organization on Github`_, including:
 
-OAuth takes many forms, so let's take a look at a few different forms::
+- OAuth_
+- Kerberos_
+- NTLM_
 
-    import requests
-    from requests.auth import OAuth1
+If you want to use any of these forms of authentication, go straight to their
+Github page and follow the instructions. If you can't find the one you want,
+why not write one and submit it?
