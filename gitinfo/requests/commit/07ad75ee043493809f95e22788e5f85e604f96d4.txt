    Fix #1322: Add note in docs about None not being sent as data
    
    In the case:
    
      payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': None}
      r = requests.get("http://httpbin.org", params=payload)
    
    the parameter `key3` will not be sent as a parameter in the URL.
    
    Mention this in the documentation.
