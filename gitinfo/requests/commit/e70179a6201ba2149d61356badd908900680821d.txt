    Clarify which tests to run in the Makefile
    
    If you put your Virtualenv in the same folder as Requests (as I
    usually do), py.test will pick up any test_* files inside the
    virtualenv and attempt to run them too, leading to the following error:
    https://gist.github.com/kevinburke/1aa2b07e01de3a7daa15
    
    Instead specify the test file we would like to run in the Makefile.
