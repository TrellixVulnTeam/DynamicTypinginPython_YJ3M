+CA Certificates
+---------------
+
+By default Requests bundles a set of root CAs that it trusts, sourced from the
+Mozilla trust store. However, these are only updated once for each Requests
+version. This means that if you pin a Requests version your certificates can
+become extremely out of date.
+
+From Requests version 2.4.0 onwards, Requests will attempt to use certificates
+from `certifi`_ if it is present on the system. This allows for users to update
+their trusted certificates without having to change the code that runs on their
+system.
+
+For the sake of security we recommend upgrading certifi frequently!
