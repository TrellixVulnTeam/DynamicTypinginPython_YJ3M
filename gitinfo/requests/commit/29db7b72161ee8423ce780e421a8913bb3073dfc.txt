    Test cases fail when `HTTPBIN_URL` does not have trailing slash
    
    Test cases can be run against a local httpbin server defined by
    the `HTTPBIN_URL` environment variable, but it causes tests to
    fail if the given URL does not end with a slash.
    
    Ensure that the URL always ends with a slash.
