+Semantic Versioning
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+For many years, the open source community has been plagued with version number dystonia. Numbers vary so greatly from project to project, they are practically meaningless.
+
+Requests uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_. This specification seeks to put an end to this madness with a small set of practical guidelines for you and your colleagues to use in your next project.

-Officially (as of 26-Nov-2012), requests supports python 2.6-3.3. In the
-future, support for 3.1 and 3.2 may be dropped. In general you will need to
-test on at least one python 2 and one python 3 version. You can also set up
-Travis CI for your own fork before you submit a pull request so that you are
-assured your fork works. To use Travis CI for your fork and other projects see
-their `documentation <http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/>`_.

-- Documentation needs a roadmap.
+Support for Python 3.1 and 3.2 may be dropped at any time.

+Google App Engine will never be officially supported. Pull requests for compatiblity will be accepted, as long as they don't complicate the codebase.

+- SPDY support would be awesome. No C extensions.
