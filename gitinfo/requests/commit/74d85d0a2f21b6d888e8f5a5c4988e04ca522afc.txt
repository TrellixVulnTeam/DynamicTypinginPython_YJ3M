    HISTORY: replace n-dash to workaround pip bug
    
    There exists a problem (maybe a bug?) in pip when using a locale like
    `LC_ALL=C` (which is commonly used by CI environments and system
    configuration tools such as Puppet), where the PKG-INFO file is decoded
    using ascii, raising a UnicodeDecodeError when PKG-INFO contains
    non-ASCII characters (such as the n-dash removed by this commit):

    I'm not able to reproduce this by installing the package directly, only by
    installing another package which depends on it (via `install_requires`).
    
    The command I used was `LC_ALL=C /usr/bin/pip-3.2 install --upgrade ocflib`,
    with "pip 1.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.2)" (which
    is the packaged version for Debian 7).
    
    Although this should probably be addressed ultimately in pip, replacing
    this character in HISTORY is a pain-free and pragmatic way to help
    developers and system administrators who may be stuck with old versions
    of pip for many years to come.
