+Where possible, please follow PEP8 with regard to coding style. Sometimes the line 
+length restriction is too hard to follow, so don't bend over backwards there.
+
+Triple-quotes should always be """, single quotes are ' unless using "
+would result in less escaping within the string.
+
+All modules, functions, and methods should be well documented reStructuredText for 
+Sphinx AutoDoc.
+
+All functionality should be available in pure Python. Optional C (via Cython)
+implementations may be written for performance reasons, but should never
+replace the Python implementation.
+
+Lastly, don't take yourself too seriously :)
