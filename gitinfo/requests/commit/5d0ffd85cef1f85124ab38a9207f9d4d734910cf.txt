+Code Style
+~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The Requests codebase uses the `PEP8`_ code style.
+
+In addition to the standards outlined in PEP8, we have a few guidelines:
+
+- Line-length can exceed 79 characters, to 100, when convenient.
+- Line-length can exceed 100 characters, when doing otherwise would be *terribly* inconvenient.
+- Always use single-quoted strings (e.g. ``'#flatearth'``), unless a single-quote occurs within the string.
+
+Additionally, one of the few style recommendations PEP8 makes for
+`line continuations`_ lacks all sense of taste, and is not to  be found within
+the Requests codebase::
+
+    # Aligned with opening delimiter.
+    foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
+                             var_three, var_four)
+
+Just don't. Ever.
