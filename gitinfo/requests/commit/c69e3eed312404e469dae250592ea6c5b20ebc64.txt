    Close and then release the connection
    
    urllib3 closes the underlying connection when we call
    urllib3.Response.close but does not release it back to the connection
    pool. This can cause issues when users have a blocking connection pool
    configured and connections are not readily returned to the pool.
    
    Since the underlying connection is closed, we should be able to safely
    return the connection to the connection pool, so to fix this issue we
    merely need to not return after closing the response.
    
    Closes gh-3461
