 We can read the content of the server's response::

+Requests will automatically decode content from the server. Most unicode

 When you make a request, ``r.encoding`` is set, based on the HTTP headers.
-Requests will attempt to use that encoding when you access ``r.content``. You
-can manually set ``r.encoding`` to any encoding you'd like (including ``None``),

+Binary Response Content
+-----------------------

+You can also access the response body as bytes, for non-text requests::

+The ``gzip`` and ``deflate`` transfer-encodings are automatically decoded for you.

+Raw Response Content
+--------------------
+
+In the rare case that you'd like to get the absolute raw socket response from the server,
+you can access ``r.raw``::
+
+    >>> r.raw
+    <requests.packages.urllib3.response.HTTPResponse object at 0x101194810>
+
+    >>> r.raw.read(10)
