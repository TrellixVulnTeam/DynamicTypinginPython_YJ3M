    Added ability to check if missing trailing slash in path.
    
    Previously this URL would not work:
    
        http://example.com?foo=bar
    
    But this URL would work:
    
        http://example.com/?foo=bar
    
    Even though a slash is required for a valid URL, it is a common use case
    for the slash to be left out, so it would be a good idea to account for this.
