+Debian and other distributions "unbundle" requests' vendored dependencies, and
+rewrite all imports to use the global versions of ``urllib3`` and ``chardet``.
+The problem with this is that not only requests itself imports those
+dependencies, but third-party code outside of the distros' control too.
+
+In reaction to these problems, the distro maintainers replaced
+``requests.packages`` with a magical "stub module" that imports the correct
+modules. The implementations were varying in quality and all had severe
+problems. For example, a symlink (or hardlink) that links the correct modules
+into place introduces problems regarding object identity, since you now have
+two modules in `sys.modules` with the same API, but different identities::
+
+    requests.packages.urllib3 is not urllib3
+
+With version ``2.5.2``, requests started to maintain its own stub, so that
+distro-specific breakage would be reduced to a minimum, even though the whole
+issue is not requests' fault in the first place. See
+https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/2375 for the corresponding pull
+request.
