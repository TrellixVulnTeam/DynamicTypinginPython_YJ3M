 To send a chunk-encoded request, simply provide a generator (or any iterator without
 a length) for your body::
 
-
     def gen():
         yield 'hi'
         yield 'there'
 
     requests.post('http://some.url/chunked', data=gen())
 
+For chunked encoded responses, it's best to iterate over the data using
+:meth:`Response.iter_content() <requests.models.Response.iter_content>`. In
+an ideal situation you'll have set ``stream=True`` on the request, in which
+case you can iterate chunk-by-chunk by calling ``iter_content`` with a chunk
+size parameter of ``None``.
