+Release Process and Rules
+=========================
+
+.. versionadded:: v2.6.2
+
+Starting with the version to be released after ``v2.6.2``, the following rules 
+will govern and describe how the Requests core team produces a new release.
+
+Major Releases
+--------------
+
+A major release will include breaking changes. When it is versioned, it will 
+be versioned as ``vX.0.0``. For example, if the previous release was 
+``v10.2.9`` the next version will be ``v11.0.0``.
+
+Breaking changes are changes that break backwards compatibility with prior 
+versions. If the project were to change the ``text`` attribute on a 
+``Response`` object to a method, that would only happen in a Major release.
+
+Major releases may also include miscellaneous bug fixes and upgrades to 
+vendored packages.
+
+Minor Releases
+--------------
+
+A minor release will not include breaking changes but may include 
+miscellaneous bug fixes and upgrades to vendored packages. If the previous 
+version of Requests released was ``v10.2.9`` a minor release would be 
+versioned as ``v10.3.0``.
+
+Minor releases will be backwards compatible with releases that have the same 
+major version number. In other words, all versions that would start with 
+``v10.`` should be compatible with each other.
+
+Hotfix Releases
+---------------
+
+A hotfix release will only include bug fixes that were missed when the project 
+released the previous version. If the previous version of Requests released 
+``v10.2.9`` the hotfix release would be versioned as ``v10.2.10``.
+
+Hotfixes will **not** include upgrades to vendored dependences after 
+``v2.6.2``
+
+Reasoning
+---------
+
+In the 2.5 and 2.6 release series, the Requests core team upgraded vendored 
+dependencies and caused a great deal of headaches for both users and the core 
+team. To reduce this pain, we're forming a concrete set of procedures so 
+expectations will be properly set.
