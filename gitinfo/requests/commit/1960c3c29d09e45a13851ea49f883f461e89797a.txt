+Requests uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_. This specification seeks to put an end to this madness with a small set of practical guidelines for you and your colleagues to use in your next project.
+
+Standard Library?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Requests has no *active* plans to be included in the standard library. This decision has been discussed at length with Guido as well as numerous core developers.
+
+Essentially, the standard library is where a library goes to die. It is appropriate for a module to be included when active development is no longer necessary.
+
+Requests just reached v1.0.0. This huge milestone marks a major step in the right direction.
+
+Linux Distro Packages
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Distributions for Requests have been made for many Linux distributions, including: Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, and Arch.
+
+These distributions are often aggressive forks. They are discouraged and not supported.
