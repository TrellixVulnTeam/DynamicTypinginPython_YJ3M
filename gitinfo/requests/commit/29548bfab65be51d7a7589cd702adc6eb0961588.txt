-Where possible, please follow PEP8 with regard to coding style. Sometimes the
-line length restriction is too hard to follow, so don't bend over backwards
-there.
-
-Triple-quotes should always be """, single quotes are ' unless using " would
-result in less escaping within the string.
-
-All modules, functions, and methods should be well documented reStructuredText
-for Sphinx AutoDoc.
-
-All functionality should be available in pure Python. Optional C (via Cython)
-implementations may be written for performance reasons, but should never
-replace the Python implementation.
-
-Lastly, don't take yourself too seriously :)
