-**Bugfixes**
+**Improvements**
+
+- pyOpenSSL TLS implementation is now only used if Python
+  either doesn't have an `ssl` module or doesn't support
+  SNI. Previously pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available.
+  This applies even if pyOpenSSL is installed via the
+  `requests[security]` extra (#5443)
