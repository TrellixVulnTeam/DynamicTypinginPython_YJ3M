    Move SNI documentation to FAQ
    
    Relocate documentation on Server-Name-Indication from the advanced
    section to the frequently asked questions. This is minus details on
    enabling SNI on Python2, which is instead captured by linking to Stack
    Overflow.

+What are "hostname doesn't match" errors?
+-----------------------------------------
+
+These errors occur when :ref:`SSL certificate verification <verification>`
+fails to match the certificate the server responds with to the hostname
+Requests thinks it's contacting. If you're certain the server's SSL setup is
+correct (for example, because you can visit the site with your browser) a
+possible explanation is Request's is lacking Server-Name-Indication.
+
+`Server-Name-Indication`_, or SNI, is an official extension to SSL where the
+client tells the server what hostname it is contacting. This enables `virtual
+hosting`_ on SSL protected sites, the server being to able to respond with a
+certificate appropriate for the hostname the client is contacting.
+
+Python3's SSL module includes native support for SNI. This support has not been
+back ported to Python2. For information on using SNI with Requests on Python2
+refer to this `Stack Overflow answer`_.

-`Server Name Indication`_, or SNI, is an official extension to SSL where the
-client tells the server what hostname it is contacting. This enables `virtual
-hosting`_ on SSL protected sites.
-
-Python3's SSL module includes native support for SNI. This support has not been
-back ported to Python2. However, Requests will enable SNI support on Python2 if
-the following packages are installed:
-
-* `pyOpenSSL`_, a Python wrapper module around the OpenSSL library.
-* `ndg-httpsclient`_, enhanced HTTPS support for httplib and urllib2.
-* `pyasn1`_, ASN.1 types and codecs.
-
-When these packages are installed, Requests will automatically indicate to the
-server what hostname is being contacted. This allows the server to return the
-correct server certificate for SSL certificate verification.
