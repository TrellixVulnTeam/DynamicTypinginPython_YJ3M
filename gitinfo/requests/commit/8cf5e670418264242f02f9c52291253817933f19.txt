+Recommended Packages
+====================
+
+Requests has a great variety of powerful and useful third-party extensions.
+This page provides an overview of some of the best of them.
+
+CacheControl
+------------
+
+`CacheControl`_ is an extension that adds a full HTTP cache to requests. This
+makes your web requests substantially more efficient, and should be used
+whenever you're making a lot of web requests.

+
+Requests-Oauthlib
+-----------------
+
+`requests-oauthlib`_ makes it possible to do the OAuth dance from requests
+automatically. This is useful for the large number of websites that use OAuth
+to provide authentication. It also provides a lot of tweaks that handle ways
+that specific OAuth providers differ from the standard specifications.
