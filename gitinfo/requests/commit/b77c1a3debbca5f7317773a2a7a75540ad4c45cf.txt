    Correct urllib3 compatibility comment
    
    So that it's in line with the code. I saw the warning raised recently and had to dive into the code for exact compatibility, but I stopped after reading the comment rather than the code.
    Maybe a better solution would be to surface the supported versions in the warning, but I see it was changed recently in https://github.com/requests/requests/pull/4144/
