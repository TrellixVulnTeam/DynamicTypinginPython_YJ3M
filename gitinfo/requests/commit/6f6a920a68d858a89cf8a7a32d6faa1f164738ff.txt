    Improve documentation of netrc authentication
    
    The documentation does not make it clear that when the credentials
    from netrc are used, Requests authenticates with HTTP Basic Auth.
    
    I just spent ages trying to figure out why it wasn't working, and
    it was because although the credentials in the netrc were correct,
    the server actually required HTTP Digest Auth.
    
    Add a section in the authentication documentation to make it clear
    that HTTP Basic Auth is used.

+netrc Authentication
+--------------------
+
+If no authentication method is given with the ``auth`` argument, Requests will
+attempt to get the authentication credentials for the URL's hostname from the
+user's netrc file.
+
+If credentials for the hostname are found, the request is sent with HTTP Basic
+Auth.
