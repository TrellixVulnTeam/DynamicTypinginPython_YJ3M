+*A TensorFlow implementation of the models described in [Unsupervised Learning for Physical Interaction through Video Prediction (Finn et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07157).*
 
 This video prediction model, which is optionally conditioned on actions,
 predictions future video by internally predicting how to transform the last
