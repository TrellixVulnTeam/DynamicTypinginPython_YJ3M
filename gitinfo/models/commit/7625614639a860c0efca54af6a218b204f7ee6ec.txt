    Small edits to DELF markdown instructions (#6839)
    
    * Initial feature aggregation code for Detect-to-Retrieve paper.
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 246043144
    
    * Add support for ASMK/ASMK*/R-ASMK/R-ASMK*.
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 247337028
    
    * Add DatumProto uint32 field, and limit datum_io to uint32 and float32/float64 types.
    
    Also, introduce DatumPairProto, to be used for ASMK variants. Functions to read/write in this new format are added and tested.
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 247515205
    
    * Add batching option to feature aggregation extraction.
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 247614627
    
    * Script to perform local feature aggregation, with associated configs.
    
    Also small edits to the aggregation extractor, for better handling of input features / avoiding OOM.
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 248150750
    
    * Tests to check that aggregation using regions with no local features works.
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 248153275
    
    * Include new library/proto for aggregation
