    Add explicit tensorflow version to deeplab_demo.ipynb (#7964)
    
    Colab will soon update the default version of tensorflow to 2.1.0. In order for this notebook to continue to work, I'm adding a line magic that will ensure this notebook continues to use tensorflow 1.x and execute without errors.
