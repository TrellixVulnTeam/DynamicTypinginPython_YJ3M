-Download and extract the data from [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9tvtcv6lmy51zfw/data.zip?dl=0). Change the ``data_dir FLAG`` to the location of the data.
+Download and extract the data from the [WikiTableQuestions](https://ppasupat.github.io/WikiTableQuestions/) site. The dataset contains
+11321, 2831, and 4344 examples for training, development, and testing respectively. We use their tokenization, number and date pre-processing. Please note that the above paper used the [initial release](https://github.com/ppasupat/WikiTableQuestions/releases/tag/v0.2) for training, development and testing.

+Change the `data_dir FLAG` to the location of the data.
 
 ### Training 
-``python neural_programmer.py`` 
+Run `python neural_programmer.py` 
 
-The models are written to FLAGS.output_dir

 ### Testing 
-``python neural_programmer.py --evaluator_job=True``
+Run `python neural_programmer.py --evaluator_job=True`
 
-The models are loaded from ``FLAGS.output_dir``. The evaluation is done on development data.
