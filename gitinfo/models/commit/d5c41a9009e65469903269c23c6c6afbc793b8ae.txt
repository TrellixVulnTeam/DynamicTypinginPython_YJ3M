+Thank you for submitting a TensorFlow documentation issue. Per our GitHub
+policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and
+build/installation issues on GitHub.
+
+The TensorFlow docs are open source! To get involved, read the documentation
+contributor guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs
+
+## URL(s) with the issue:
+
+Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
+https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM
+
+## Description of issue (what needs changing):
+
+### Clear description
+
+For example, why should someone use this method? How is it useful?
+
+### Correct links
+
+Is the link to the source code correct?
+
+### Parameters defined
+
+Are all parameters defined and formatted correctly?
+
+### Returns defined
+
+Are return values defined?
+
+### Raises listed and defined
+
+Are the errors defined? For example,
+https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file#raises
+
+### Usage example
+
+Is there a usage example?
+
+See the API guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs_ref
+on how to write testable usage examples.
+
+### Request visuals, if applicable
+
+Are there currently visuals? If not, will it clarify the content?
+
+### Submit a pull request?
+
+Are you planning to also submit a pull request to fix the issue? See the docs
+contributor guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs,
