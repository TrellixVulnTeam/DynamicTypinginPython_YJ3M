 Inference preserves all fields of the input TFExamples, and adds new fields to
 store the inferred detections. This allows [computing evaluation

 truth boxes are preserved as well. Since measure computations don't require
 access to the images, `infer_detections` can optionally discard them with the
 `--discard_image_pixels` flag. Discarding the images drastically reduces the
