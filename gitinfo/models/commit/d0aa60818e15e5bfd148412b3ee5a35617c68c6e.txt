 # TensorFlow Official Models
 
-The TensorFlow official models are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read.
+The TensorFlow official models are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read.
+
+The master branch of the models are **in development**, and they target the [nightly binaries](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#installation) built from the [master branch of TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master).
+
+**Stable versions** of the official models targeting releases of TensorFlow are available as tagged branches or [downloadable releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases). Model repository version numbers match the target TensorFlow release, such that [branch r1.4.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.4.0) and [release v1.4.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases/tag/v1.4.0) are compatible with [TensorFlow v1.4.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
+
+If you are on a version of TensorFlow earlier than v1.4, please [update your installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
 
-Currently the models are compatible with TensorFlow 1.4. If you are on an earlier version please [update your installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
