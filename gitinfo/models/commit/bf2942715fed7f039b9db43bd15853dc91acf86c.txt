    Fix PythonPath dependencies
    
    Previously, code block one attempted to import `from object_detection.utils` before the `object_detection` directory was added to the PythonPath via `sys.path.append("..")`.
    
    This generated a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
    
    Accordingly, append `".."` to the PythonPath before attempting to import from `object_detection` as a module, instead of after.
