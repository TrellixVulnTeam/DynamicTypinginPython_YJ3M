 The linked model tar files contain the following:
-- Trained model checkpoints
-- Eval graph text protos (to be easily viewed)
-- Frozen trained models
-- Info file containing input and output information
-- Converted [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/) flatbuffer model

 Note that quantized model GraphDefs are still float models, they just have FakeQuantization
 operation embedded to simulate quantization. These are converted by [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/)
