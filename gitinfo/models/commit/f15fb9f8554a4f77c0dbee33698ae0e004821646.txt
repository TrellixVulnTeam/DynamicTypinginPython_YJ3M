 ## Overview
 The [Census Income Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) contains over 48,000 samples with attributes including age, occupation, education, and income (a binary label, either `>50K` or `<=50K`). The dataset is split into roughly 32,000 training and 16,000 testing samples.
