+   NotFoundError (see above for traceback): Restoring from checkpoint failed. This is most likely due to a Variable name or other graph    key that is missing from the checkpoint. Please ensure that you have not altered the graph expected based on the checkpoint. Original    error:

+
+   This is an issue with seq2seq model because it uses the attention mechanism.
+   The issue arises if you saved the model with an earlier version (seq2seq is old) and restore with a recent one (saver.restore got updated).
+   The naming convention for LSTM parameters changed, e.g. cell_0/basic_lstm_cell/weights became cell_0/basic_lstm_cell/kernel.
+   Which is why you cannot restore them if you try to restore old checkpoints with recent TF.
+   The below script will help rename the variables and everything will work as expected.
