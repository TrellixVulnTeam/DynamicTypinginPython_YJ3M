 The code is not optimized and some computation is repeated for ease of
 implementation. We hope that this code will be a useful starting point for future research in this area.

+The _generator_network function has separate paths for the unconditional and conditional generative models. In the conditional generative models code path, the generative model does not have multiple stochastic layers even when n_layers is > 1. My intention was to have multiple stochastic layers in the conditional generative model, however, due to a bug this is not how it was implemented. As the code is currently, with the conditional generative model and n_layers > 1, the recognition network has multiple stochastic layers, but the generative model has a single stochastic layer.
