+## Natural Language Processing
+
+*   [bert](nlp/bert): A powerful pre-trained language representation model:
+    BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
+    Transformers.
+*   [transformer](transformer): A transformer model to translate the WMT
+    English to German dataset.
+
+## Computer Vision
+
+*   [mnist](vision/image_classification): A basic model to classify digits
+    from the MNIST dataset.
+*   [resnet](vision/image_classification): A deep residual network that can
+    be used to classify ImageNet's dataset of 1000 classes.
+*   [retinanet](vision/detection): A fast and powerful object detector.
