+On Mac, add `-undefined dynamic_lookup` to the g++ command. The flag `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` is included to support newer versions of gcc. However, if you compiled TensorFlow from source using gcc 5 or later, you may need to exclude the flag. Specifically, if you get an error similar to the following: `word2vec_ops.so: undefined symbol: _ZN10tensorflow7strings6StrCatERKNS0_8AlphaNumES3_S3_S3_` then you likely need to exclude the flag.
