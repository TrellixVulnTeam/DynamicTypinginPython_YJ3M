-# Legacy Models Collection
+![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/No%20Maintenance%20Intended-%E2%9C%95-red.svg)
 
-The R1 folder contains legacy model implmentation and models that will not
-update to TensorFlow 2.x. They do not have solid performance tracking.
+# Legacy Models
 
-**Note: models will be removed from the master branch by 2020/06.**
+The **r1** folder contains legacy model implementations developed
+using TensorFlow 1.x.
 
-After removal, you can still access to these legacy models in the previous
-released tags, e.g. [v2.1.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
+**Note: We will remove this r1 folder from the master branch in June, 2020.**
 
+After removal, you will still be able to access legacy models
+in the previous releases.
+(e.g., [v2.1.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases/tag/v2.1.0))
 
-## Legacy model implmentation
-
-Transformer and MNIST implementation uses pure TF 1.x TF-Estimator.
-Users should follow the corresponding TF 2.x implmentation inside the
-official model garden.
-
-## Models that will not update to TensorFlow 2.x
-
-*   [boosted_trees](boosted_trees): A Gradient Boosted Trees model to
-    classify higgs boson process from HIGGS Data Set.
-*   [wide_deep](wide_deep): A model that combines a wide model and deep
-    network to classify census income data.
