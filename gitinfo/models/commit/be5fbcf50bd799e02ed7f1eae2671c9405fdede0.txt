         "No matter how we choose to define a `SparseColumn`, each feature string is mapped into an integer ID by looking up a fixed mapping or by hashing. Under the hood, the `LinearModel` class is responsible for managing the mapping and creating `tf.Variable` to store the model parameters (model *weights*) for each feature ID. The model parameters are learned through the model training process described later.\n",
