 Supercharge your mobile phones with the next generation mobile object detector!
 We are adding support for MobileNet V2 with SSDLite presented in
 [MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381).
-Along with the model definition, we are also releasing a model checkpoint trained on COCO dataset.
