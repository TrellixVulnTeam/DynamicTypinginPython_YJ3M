-Brain coder is a code synthesis experimental environment. We provide code that reproduces the results from our recent paper [Code Synthesis with Priority Queue Training](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1AoGNlC-). See single_task/README.md for details on how to build and reproduce those experiments.
