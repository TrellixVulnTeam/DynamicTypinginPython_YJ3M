         "1. The first layer is an `Embedding` layer. This layer takes the integer-encoded vocabulary and looks up the embedding vector for each word-index. These vectors are learned as the model trains. The vectors add a dimension to the output array. The resulting dimensions are: `(batch, sequence, embedding)`.\n",
         "2. Next, a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer returns a fixed-length output vector for each example by averaging over the sequence dimension. This allows the model can handle input of variable length, in the simplest way possible.\n",
