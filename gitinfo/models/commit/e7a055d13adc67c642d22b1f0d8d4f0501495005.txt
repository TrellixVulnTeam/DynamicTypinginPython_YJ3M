 You can export the model into Tensorflow [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) format by using the argument `--export_dir`:
 
 ```
-python wide_deep.py --export_dir /tmp/wide_deep_saved_model
+python census_main.py --export_dir /tmp/wide_deep_saved_model
 ```
 
 After the model finishes training, use [`saved_model_cli`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#cli_to_inspect_and_execute_savedmodel) to inspect and execute the SavedModel.
