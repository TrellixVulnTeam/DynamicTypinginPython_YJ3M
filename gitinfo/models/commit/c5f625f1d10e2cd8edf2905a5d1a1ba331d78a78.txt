-        "When the model from Figure 2 is trained and fed an unlabeled example, it yields three predictions: the likelihood that this flower is the given Iris species. This prediction is called *[inference](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/glossary#inference)*. For this example, the sum of the output predictions are 1.0. In Figure 2, this prediction breaks down as: `0.03` for *Iris setosa*, `0.95` for *Iris versicolor*, and `0.02` for *Iris virginica*. This means that the model predicts—with 95% probability—that an unlabeled example flower is an *Iris versicolor*."
