    Correction (and clarification) to EWMA doc (#26422)
    
    * Correction (and clarification) to EWMA doc
    
    Correct ``adjust=True`` to ``adjust=False`` in line 889 of the documentation (discussing EWMA).
    Also propose minor clarifications in demonstration that two variants (adjust=False and adjust=True) are equivalent for infinite series (lines 868 and 887-893).
    
    * Removed trailing whitespace
    
    * Removed comma splice and added commas
