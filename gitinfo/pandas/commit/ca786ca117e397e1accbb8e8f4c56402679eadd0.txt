    DOC: mention other packages in IO docs (for now, just xray for netCDF)
    
    As discussed in #5487.
    
    This would also be a nice place to mention other packages that connect the
    pandas DataFrames with other file formats. Right now, the only one I can think
    of off-hand is `root_pandas` (#9378, CC @ibab), but I'm sure there are more.

+Other file formats
+------------------
+
+pandas itself only supports IO with a limited set of file formats that map
+cleanly to its tabular data model. For reading and writing other file formats
+into and from pandas, we recommend these packages from the broader community.
+
+netCDF
+~~~~~~
+
+xray_ provides data structures inspired by the pandas DataFrame for working
+with multi-dimensional datasets, with a focus on the netCDF file format and
+easy conversion to and from pandas.
