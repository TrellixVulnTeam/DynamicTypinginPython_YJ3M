+Optionally, you may wish to setup `pre-commit hooks <https://pre-commit.com/>`_
+to automatically run ``black`` and ``flake8`` when you make a git commit. This
+can be done by installing ``pre-commit``::
+
+   pip install pre-commit
+
+and then running::
+
+   pre-commit install

+from the root of the pandas repository. Now ``black`` and ``flake8`` will be run

 This command will catch any stylistic errors in your changes specifically, but
 be beware it may not catch all of them. For example, if you delete the only
 usage of an imported function, it is stylistically incorrect to import an
