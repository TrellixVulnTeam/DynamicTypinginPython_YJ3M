    DOC/TST: Added NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE flag (#20284)
    
    * DOC/TST: Added NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE flag
    
    I think we want this to be always on. You can disable it with
    
    ```
    doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    ```
    
    if necessary.
    
    * Added IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL for consistency
