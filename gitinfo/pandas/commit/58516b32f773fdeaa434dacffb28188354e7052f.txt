    CLN: Remove internal classes from MultiIndex pickle.
    
    FrozenNDArray had made it into the MI pickle. No reason to do that and
    just complicates pickle compat going forward. Now they just output
    ndarray instead (which also avoids the unnecessary nested pickle
    previously occurring).
