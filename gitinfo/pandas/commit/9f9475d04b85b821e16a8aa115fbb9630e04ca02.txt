+****************
+Pandas Ecosystem
+****************
+
+Increasingly, packages are being built on top of pandas to address specific needs
+in data preparation, analysis and visualization.
+This is encouraging because it means pandas is not only helping users to handle
+their data tasks but also that provides a better starting point for developers to
+build powerful and more focused data tools.
+The creation of libraries that complement pandas' functionality also allows pandas
+development to remain focused around it's original requirements.
+
+This is an in-exhaustive list of projects that build on pandas in order to provide
+tools in the PyData space.
+
+We'd like to make it easier for users to find these project, if you know of other
+substantial projects that you feel should be on this list, please let us know.
+
+`Statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net>`__
+-----------
+
+Statsmodels is the prominent python "statistics and econometrics library" and it has
+a long-standing special relationship with pandas. Statsmodels provides powerful statistics,
+econometrics, analysis and modeling functionality that is out of pandas' scope.
+Statsmodels leverages pandas objects as the underlying data container for computation.
+
+`Vincent <https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent>`__
+-------
+
+The `Vincent <https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent>`__ project leverages `Vega <https://github.com/trifacta/vega>`__ to create
+plots (that in turn, leverages `d3 <http://d3js.org/>`__). It has great support for pandas data objects.
+
+`yhat/ggplot <https://github.com/yhat/ggplot>`__
+-----------
+
+Hadley Wickham's `ggplot2 <http://ggplot2.org/>`__is a foundational exploratory visualization package for the R language.
+Based on `"The Grammer of Graphics" <http://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html>`__ it
+provides a powerful, declarative and extremely general way to generate plots of arbitrary data.
+It's really quite incredible. Various implementations to other languages are available,
+but a faithful implementation for python users has long been missing. Although still young
+(as of Jan-2014), the `yhat/ggplot <https://github.com/yhat/ggplot>` project has been
+progressing quickly in that direction.
+
+
+`Seaborn <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>`__
+-------
+
+Although pandas has quite a bit of "just plot it" functionality built-in, visualization and
+in particular statistical graphics is a vast field with a long tradition and lots of ground
+to cover. `The Seaborn project <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>`__ builds on top of pandas
+and `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`__ to provide easy plotting of data which extends to
+more advanced types of plots then those offered by pandas.
+
+
+`Geopandas <https://github.com/kjordahl/geopandas>`__
+---------
+
+Geopandas extends pandas data objects to include geographic information which support
+geometric operations. If your work entails maps and geographical coordinates, and
+you love pandas, you should take a close look at Geopandas.

-************************
-Related Python libraries
-************************
-
-la (larry)
-----------
-
-Keith Goodman's excellent `labeled array package
-<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/la>`__ is very similar to pandas in many regards,
-though with some key differences. The main philosophical design difference is
-to be a wrapper around a single NumPy ``ndarray`` object while adding axis
-labeling and label-based operations and indexing. Because of this, creating a
-size-mutable object with heterogeneous columns (e.g. DataFrame) is not possible
-with the ``la`` package.
-
-  - Provide a single n-dimensional object with labeled axes with functionally
-    analogous data alignment semantics to pandas objects
-  - Advanced / label-based indexing similar to that provided in pandas but
-    setting is not supported
-  - Stays much closer to NumPy arrays than pandas-- ``larry`` objects must be
-    homogeneously typed
-  - GroupBy support is relatively limited, but a few functions are available:
-    ``group_mean``, ``group_median``, and ``group_ranking``
-  - It has a collection of analytical functions suited to quantitative
-    portfolio construction for financial applications
-  - It has a collection of moving window statistics implemented in
-    `Bottleneck <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Bottleneck>`__
-
-statsmodels
------------
-
-The main `statistics and econometrics library
-<http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net>`__ for Python. pandas has become a
-dependency of this library.
-
-scikits.timeseries
-------------------
-
-`scikits.timeseries <http://pytseries.sourceforge.net/>`__ provides a data
-structure for fixed frequency time series data based on the numpy.MaskedArray
-class. For time series data, it provides some of the same functionality to the
-pandas Series class. It has many more functions for time series-specific
-manipulation. Also, it has support for many more frequencies, though less
-customizable by the user (so 5-minutely data is easier to do with pandas for
-example).
-
-We are aiming to merge these libraries together in the near future.
-
-Progress:
-
-  - It has a collection of moving window statistics implemented in
-    `Bottleneck <http://pandas.pydata.org/developers.html#development-roadmap>`__
-  - `Outstanding issues <https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues?labels=timeseries&milestone=&page=1&state=open>`__
-
-Summarising, Pandas offers superior functionality due to its combination with the :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame`.
-
-An introduction for former users of :mod:`scikits.timeseries` is provided in the :ref:`migration guide <ref-scikits-migration>`.
