 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
+Thanks to all of the contributors who participated in the Pandas Documentation
+Sprint, which took place on March 10th. We had about 500 participants from over
+30 locations across the world. You should notice that many of the
+:ref:`API docstrings <api>` have greatly improved.
+
+There were too many simultaneous contributions to include a release note for each
+improvement, but this `GitHub search`_ should give you an idea of how many docstrings
+were improved.
+
+Special thanks to Marc Garcia for organizing the sprint. For more information,
+read the `NumFOCUS blogpost`_ recapping the sprint.
