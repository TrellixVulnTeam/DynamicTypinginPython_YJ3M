    Reading your data into pandas is pretty much the easiest thing. Even
    when the encoding is wrong!

    It's not totally obvious how to select data from a pandas dataframe.
    Here we explain the basics (how to take slices and get columns)

    Here we get into serious slicing and dicing and learn how to filter
    dataframes in complicated ways, really fast.

    Groupby/aggregate is seriously my favorite thing about pandas
    and I use it all the time. You should probably read this.

    Here you get to find out if it's cold in Montreal in the winter
    (spoiler: yes). Web scraping with pandas is fun! Here we combine dataframes.

    Strings with pandas are great. It has all these vectorized string
    operations and they're the best. We will turn a bunch of strings
    containing "Snow" into vectors of numbers in a trice.
--  `Chapter 7: <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/v0.2/cookbook/Chapter%207%20-%20Cleaning%20up%20messy%20data.ipynb>`_

    Cleaning up messy data is never a joy, but with pandas it's easier.

    Parsing Unix timestamps is confusing at first but it turns out
    to be really easy.
