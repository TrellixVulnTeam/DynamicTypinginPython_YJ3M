    BUG: #1982 fix index.summary() to handle unicode in indices
    
    internal representations should be unicode objects, not
    strings, conversion should be at I/O contact-points only.
    
    Note: this still does not address the problem of pprinting
    indices that have a tuple of unicode strings, as a value.
    This issue came up before, monkey-patched in f4e3ab6b922d69,
    but second time around - a more general solution is needed.
