+Groupby by Indexer to 'resample' data
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Resampling produces new hypothetical samples(resamples) from already existing observed data or from a model that generates data. These new samples are similar to the pre-existing samples.
+
+In order to resample to work on indices that are non-datetimelike , the following procedure can be utilized.
+
+In the following examples, **df.index // 5** returns a binary array which is used to determine what get's selected for the groupby operation.
+
+.. note:: The below example shows how we can downsample by consolidation of samples into fewer samples. Here by using **df.index // 5**, we are aggregating the samples in bins. By applying **std()** function, we aggregate the information contained in many samples into a small subset of values which is their standard deviation thereby reducing the number of samples.
