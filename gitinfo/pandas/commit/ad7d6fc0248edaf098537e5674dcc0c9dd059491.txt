 The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
 containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
-for Series, and Panel is a container for DataFrame objects. We would like to be
+for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
 able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
 fashion.
