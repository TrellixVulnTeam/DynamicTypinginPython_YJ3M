+What is it
+----------
+
+**pandas** is a library of powerful labeled-axis data structures, statistical
+tools, and general code for working with relational data sets, including time
+series and cross-sectional data. It was designed with the practical needs of
+statistical modeling and large, inhomogeneous data sets in mind. It is
+particularly well suited for, among other things, financial data analysis
+applications.

   - Added column attribute access to DataFrame, e.g. df.A equivalent to df['A']

 **Bug fixes**
