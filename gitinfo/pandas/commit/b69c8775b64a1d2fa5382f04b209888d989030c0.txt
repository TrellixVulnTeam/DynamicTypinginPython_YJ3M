    DOC: Add gotcha about flake8-ing diff
    
    The `flake8`-ing the diff will not catch any import style errors.  I
    put an alternative check that is more comprehensive but will take
    longer to run since you will be checking entire files instead of the
    diff.

+This command will catch any stylistic errors in your changes specifically, but
+be beware it may not catch all of them. For example, if you delete the only
+usage of an imported function, it is stylistically incorrect to import an
+unused function. However, style-checking the diff will not catch this because
