    ENH: Keep original traceback in DataFrame.apply
    
    When "raise <exception instance>" is used inside a try/except block, the
    original stacktrace (containing the code path that raised the original
    exception).  This makes debugging difficult since all we know is that an error
    occured when `frame._apply_standard` attempted to call the provided function.
    Preserve the original stacktrace by using "raise" instead of "raise <exception
    instance>".  This facilitates debugginb by allowing us to see where (in the
    provided callable) the exception occured.
    
    Added mention of this change in release notes
