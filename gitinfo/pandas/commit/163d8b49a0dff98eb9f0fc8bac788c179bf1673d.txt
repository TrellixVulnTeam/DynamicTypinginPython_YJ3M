 ------------------------------
 
 All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
-altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be changed,
-but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However, the vast
-majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data untouched. In
-general, though, we like to **favor immutability** where sensible.
