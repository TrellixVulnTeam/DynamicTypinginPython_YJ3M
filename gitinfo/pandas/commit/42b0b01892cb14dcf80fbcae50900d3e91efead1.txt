-The pandas data model is relatively simple: link data to a set of
-unique labels. This labelling is implemented through the
-:class:`Index` class:
-
-.. class:: Index
-
-   a 1-D NumPy :class:`~numpy.ndarray` subclass which represents an
-   *ordered set*.
-
-   :Parameters:
-       **labels** : {array_like}
-
-           Any data that is valid for constructing a 1-D
-           :class:`~numpy.ndarray` can be used here. The order of the
-           labels is preserved and they need not be sorted.
-
-.. note::
-
-    An Index instance will always be of **object** dtype. The reason
-    for this is to avoid occasional type-casting snafus when holding
-    strings in NumPy arrays.
-
-Usage and behavior
-------------------
-
-In general, users will seldom need to create Index instances
-themselves. However, understanding their internal structure will
-be important for developers. Creating an Index is simple:
-
-::
-
-    >>> index = Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
-    >>> index
-    Index([a, b, c, d, e], dtype=object)
-
-The Index stores the labels in two ways: one as a vector, and the
-other in a dict:
-
-::
-
-    >>> index.indexMap
-    {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2, 'd': 3, 'e': 4}
-
-This dict allows the pandas data structures to perform fast lookups
-and determine membership:
-
-::
-
-    >>> 'a' in index
-    True
-    >>> 'f' in index
-    False
-
-Slicing produces a new index with the **indexMap** field adjusted
-appropriately.
-
-::
-
-    >>> index_slice = index[2:]
-    >>> index_slice.indexMap
-    {'c': 0, 'd': 1, 'e': 2}
-
-To prevent undesired behavior, Index instances are immutable:
-
-::
-
-    In [11]: index[2] = 'd'
-	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-	Exception                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
-
-	pandas/core/index.pyc in __setitem__(self, key, value)
-	     98     def __setitem__(self, key, value):
-	     99         """Disable the setting of values."""
-	--> 100         raise Exception(str(self.__class__) + ' object is immutable' )
-	    101
-	    102     def __getitem__(self, key):
-
-	Exception: <class 'pandas.core.index.Index'> object is immutable
-
-Convenience methods
--------------------
-
-A number of methods are provided for performing common set-like
-operations and comparisons:
-
-::
-
-    >>> index1 = Index(['a', 'b', 'c'])
-    >>> index2 = Index(['c', 'd', 'e'])
-
-    >>> index1.intersection(index2)
-    Index([c], dtype=object)
-
-    >>> index1.union(index2)
-    Index([a, b, c, d, e], dtype=object)
-
-    >>> index1.equals(index2)
-    False
-
-.. autosummary::
-   :toctree: generated/
-
-   Index.equals
-   Index.intersection
-   Index.union
