 To appropriately address all these environments, the display behavior is controlled
 by several options, which you're encouraged to tweak to suit your setup.
 
-As of 0.12, these are the relevant options, all under the `display` namespace,

+As of 0.13, these are the relevant options, all under the `display` namespace,
+(e.g. ``display.width``,  etc.):
 
 - notebook_repr_html: if True, IPython frontends with HTML support will display
   dataframes as HTML tables when possible.
-- expand_repr (default True):  when the frame width cannot fit within the screen,
-  the output will be broken into multiple pages to accomedate. This applies to
-  textual (as opposed to HTML) display only.
-- max_columns: max dataframe columns to display. a wider frame will trigger
-  a summary view, unless `expand_repr` is True and HTML output is disabled.
-- max_rows: max dataframe rows display. a longer frame will trigger a summary view.
-- width: width of display screen in characters, used to determine the width of lines

-  width, this only works for proper terminals, not IPython frontends such as ipnb.
-  width is ignored in IPython notebook, since the browser provides horizontal scrolling.
+- large_repr (default 'truncate'): when a :class:`~pandas.DataFrame`
+  exceeds max_columns or max_rows, it can be displayed either as a
+  truncated table or, with this set to 'info', as a short summary view.
+- max_columns (default 20): max dataframe columns to display.
+- max_rows (default 60): max dataframe rows display.
+
+Two additional options only apply to displaying DataFrames in terminals,
+not to the HTML view:
+
+- expand_repr (default True):  when the frame width cannot fit within
+  the screen, the output will be broken into multiple pages.
+- width: width of display screen in characters, used to determine the
+  width of lines when expand_repr is active. Setting this to None will
+  trigger auto-detection of terminal width.
 
 IPython users can use the IPython startup file to import pandas and set these
 options automatically when starting up.
