    non-ascii bytes in "str" type are ambiguous.
    
    Since the codepoints resulting from a decode depend on the encoding,
    this test can only be an example of error handling, but the current code
    doesn't treat it as as such. so IMHO this is wrong,  it breaks
    another fix which I believe does the right thing in this respect,
    for another issue. and so It is removed by this patch.
    Unicode<-> bytes conversion and coercing should be done at I/O
    entry points, not internal code.
