+Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on `matplotlib
+<http://matplotlib.org>`__.  It provides a high-level, dataset-oriented
+interface for creating attractive statistical graphics. The plotting functions
+in seaborn understand pandas objects and leverage pandas grouping operations
+internally to support concise specification of complex visualizations. Seaborn
+also goes beyond matplotlib and pandas with the option to perform statistical
+estimation while plotting, aggregating across observations and visualizing the
+fit of statistical models to emphasize patterns in a dataset.
