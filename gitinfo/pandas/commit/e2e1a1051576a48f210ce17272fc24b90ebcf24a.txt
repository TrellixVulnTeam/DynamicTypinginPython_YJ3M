+Spyder is a cross-platform PyQt-based IDE combining the editing, analysis,
+debugging and profiling functionality of a software development tool with the
+data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection and rich visualization
+capabilities of a scientific environment like MATLAB or Rstudio.
+
+Its `Variable Explorer <https://docs.spyder-ide.org/variableexplorer.html>`__
+allows users to view, manipulate and edit pandas ``Index``, ``Series``,
+and ``DataFrame`` objects like a "spreadsheet", including copying and modifying
+values, sorting, displaying a "heatmap", converting data types and more.
+Pandas objects can also be renamed, duplicated, new columns added,
+copyed/pasted to/from the clipboard (as TSV), and saved/loaded to/from a file.
+Spyder can also import data from a variety of plain text and binary files
+or the clipboard into a new pandas DataFrame via a sophisticated import wizard.
+
+Most pandas classes, methods and data attributes can be autocompleted in
+Spyder's `Editor <https://docs.spyder-ide.org/editor.html>`__ and
+`IPython Console <https://docs.spyder-ide.org/ipythonconsole.html>`__,
+and Spyder's `Help pane<https://docs.spyder-ide.org/help.html>`__ can retrieve

+both automatically and on-demand.
