+Accelerated operations
+----------------------
+
+Pandas has support for accelerating certain types of binary numerical and boolean operations using
+the ``numexpr`` library (starting in 0.11.0) and the ``bottleneck`` libraries. 
+
+These libraries are especially useful when dealing with large data sets, and provide large
+speedups. ``numexpr`` uses smart chunking, caching, and multiple cores. ``bottleneck`` is
+a set of specialized cython routines that are especially fast when dealing with arrays that have
+``nans``.
+
+Here is a sample (using 100 column x 100,000 row ``DataFrames``):
+
+.. csv-table::
+    :header: "Operation", "0.11.0 (ms)", "Prior Vern (ms)", "Ratio to Prior"
+    :widths: 30, 30, 30, 30
+    :delim: ;
+
+    ``df1 > df2``; 13.32; 125.35;  0.1063
+    ``df1 * df2``; 21.71;  36.63;  0.5928
+    ``df1 + df2``; 22.04;  36.50;  0.6039
+
+You are highly encouraged to install both libraries. See the section 
+:ref:`Recommended Dependencies <install.recommended_dependencies>` for more installation info.
