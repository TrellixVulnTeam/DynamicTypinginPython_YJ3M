    timeseries: add tip about using groupby() rather than resample
    
    As discussed in #11217, there's another way of doing resampling that is not yet
    covered by `resample' itself. Let's document that.

+Sparse timeseries
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+If your timeseries are sparse, be aware that upsampling will generate a lot of
+intermediate points filled with whatever passed as ``fill_method``. What
+``resample`` does is basically a group by and then applying an aggregation
+method on each of its groups, which can also be achieve with something like the
+following.
