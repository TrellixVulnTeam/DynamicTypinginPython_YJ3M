 A detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the **[contributing guide.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/contributing.html)**
 
 If you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the [GitHub “issues” tab](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under [Docs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=Docs&sort=updated&state=open) and [Difficulty Novice](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Difficulty+Novice%22) where you could start out.
 
+You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas).
+
 Or maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!
 
 Feel free to ask questions on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata) or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas).
