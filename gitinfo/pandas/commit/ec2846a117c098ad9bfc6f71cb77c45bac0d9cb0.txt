 The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), so you will need to use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the project and make changes to the codebase. Once you have obtained a copy of the code, you should create a development environment that is separate from your existing Python environment so that you can make and test changes without compromising your own work environment. For more information, please refer to the "[Working with the code](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/source/development/contributing.rst#working-with-the-code)" section.
 
-Before submitting your changes for review, make sure to check that your changes do not break any tests. You can find more information about our test suites in the "[Test-driven development/code writing](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/source/contributing.rst#test-driven-development-code-writing)" section. We also have guidelines regarding coding style that will be enforced during testing, which can be found in the "[Code standards](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/source/development/contributing.rst#code-standards)" section.

Details about how to do that can be found in the "[Contributing your changes to pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/source/development/contributing.rst#contributing-your-changes-to-pandas)" section. We will review your changes, and you will most likely be asked to make additional changes before it is finally ready to merge. However, once it's ready, we will merge it, and you will have successfully contributed to the codebase!
