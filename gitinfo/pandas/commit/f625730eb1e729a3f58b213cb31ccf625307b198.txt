-        Notes
-        -----
-        In the current implementation apply calls `func` twice on the
-        first column/row to decide whether it can take a fast or slow
-        code path. This can lead to unexpected behavior if `func` has
-        side-effects, as they will take effect twice for the first
-        column/row.
