 all kinds of stores, not just tables. Two parameters are used to
 control compression: ``complevel`` and ``complib``.
 
-``complevel`` specifies if and how hard data is to be compressed.
-              ``complevel=0`` and ``complevel=None`` disables
-              compression and ``0<complevel<10`` enables compression.
-
-``complib`` specifies which compression library to use. If nothing is
-            specified the default library ``zlib`` is used. A
-            compression library usually optimizes for either good
-            compression rates or speed and the results will depend on
-            the type of data. Which type of
-            compression to choose depends on your specific needs and
-            data. The list of supported compression libraries:
-
-             - `zlib <https://zlib.net/>`_: The default compression library. A classic in terms of compression, achieves good compression rates but is somewhat slow.
-             - `lzo <https://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/>`_: Fast compression and decompression.
-             - `bzip2 <http://bzip.org/>`_: Good compression rates.
-             - `blosc <http://www.blosc.org/>`_: Fast compression and decompression.
-
-                Support for alternative blosc compressors:
-
-                - `blosc:blosclz <http://www.blosc.org/>`_ This is the
-                  default compressor for ``blosc``
-                - `blosc:lz4
-                  <https://fastcompression.blogspot.dk/p/lz4.html>`_:
-                  A compact, very popular and fast compressor.
-                - `blosc:lz4hc
-                  <https://fastcompression.blogspot.dk/p/lz4.html>`_:
-                  A tweaked version of LZ4, produces better
-                  compression ratios at the expense of speed.
-                - `blosc:snappy <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`_:
-                  A popular compressor used in many places.
-                - `blosc:zlib <https://zlib.net/>`_: A classic;
-                  somewhat slower than the previous ones, but
-                  achieving better compression ratios.
-                - `blosc:zstd <https://facebook.github.io/zstd/>`_: An
-                  extremely well balanced codec; it provides the best
-                  compression ratios among the others above, and at
-                  reasonably fast speed.
-
-             If ``complib`` is defined as something other than the
-             listed libraries a ``ValueError`` exception is issued.
