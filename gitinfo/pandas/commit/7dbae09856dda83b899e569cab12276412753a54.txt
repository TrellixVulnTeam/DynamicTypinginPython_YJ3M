+Performance matters and it is worth considering that your code has not introduced
+performance regressions.  *pandas* is in the process of migrating to the
+`asv library <https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv>`__
+to enable easy monitoring of the performance of critical *pandas* operations.
+These benchmarks are all found in the ``pandas/asv_bench`` directory.  *asv*
+supports both python2 and python3. 
+
+.. note::
+
+    The *asv* benchmark suite was translated from the previous framework, vbench,
+    so many stylistic issues are likely a result of automated transformation of the
+    code.
+
+To install asv::
+
+    pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv
+
+If you need to run a benchmark, change your directory to asv_bench/ and run
+the following if you have been developing on master::
+
+    asv continuous master
+
+Otherwise, if you are working on another branch, either of the following can be used::
+
+    asv continuous master HEAD
+    asv continuous master your_branch
+
+This will checkout the master revision and run the suite on both master and
+your commit.  Running the full test suite can take up to one hour and use up
+to 3GB of RAM.  Usually it is sufficient to paste a subset of the results in
+to the Pull Request to show that the committed changes do not cause unexpected
+performance regressions.
+
+You can run specific benchmarks using the *-b* flag which takes a regular expression.
+
+Information on how to write a benchmark can be found in
+`*asv*'s documentation http://asv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing_benchmarks.html`.
