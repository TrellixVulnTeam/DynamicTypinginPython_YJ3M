+Plan for dropping Python 2.7
+----------------------------
+
+The Python core team plans to stop supporting Python 2.7 on January 1st, 2020.
+In line with `NumPy's plans`_, all pandas releases through December 31, 2018
+will support Python 2.
+
+The final release before **December 31, 2018** will be the last release to
+support Python 2. The released package will continue to be available on
+PyPI and through conda.
+
+Starting **January 1, 2019**, all releases will be Python 3 only.
+
+If there are people interested in continued support for Python 2.7 past December
+31, 2018 (either backporting bugfixes or funding) please reach out to the
+maintainers on the issue tracker.
+
+For more information, see the `Python 3 statement`_ and the `Porting to Python 3 guide`_.
