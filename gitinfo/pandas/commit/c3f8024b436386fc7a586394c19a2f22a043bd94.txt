+Creating a Windows development environment
+------------------------------------------
+
+To build on Windows, you need to have compilers installed to build the extensions. You will need to install the appropriate Visual Studio compilers, VS 2008 for Python 2.7, VS 2010 for 3.4, and VS 2015 for Python 3.5.
+
+For Python 2.7, you can install the ``mingw`` compiler which will work equivalently to VS 2008::
+
+      conda install -n pandas_dev libpython
+
+or use the [Microsoft Visual Studio VC++ compiler for Python](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266). Note that you have to check the ``x64`` box to install the ``x64`` extension building capability as this is not installed by default.
+
+For Python 3.4, you can download and install the [Windows 7.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279)
+For Python 3.5, you can download and install the [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx).
