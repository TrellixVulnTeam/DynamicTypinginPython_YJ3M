 Changes to str.cat
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
-The :ref:`.str.cat <text.cat>` concatenates the members of a ``Series``. Before, if ``NaN`` values were present in the Series, calling ``.str.cat()`` on it would return ``NaN``, unlike the rest of the ``Series.str.*`` API. This behavior has been amended to ignore ``NaN`` values by default. (:issue:`11435`).

 A new, friendlier ``ValueError`` is added to protect against the mistake of supplying the ``sep`` as an arg, rather than as a kwarg. (:issue:`11334`).
