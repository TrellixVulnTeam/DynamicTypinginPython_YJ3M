 You can run specific benchmarks using the *-b* flag which takes a regular expression.
+For example this will only run tests from a ``pandas/asv_bench/benchmarks/groupby.py``
+file::
+
+    asv continuous master -b groupby
+
+If you want to run only some specific group of tests from a file you can do it
+using ``.`` as a separator. For example::
+
+    asv continuous master -b groupby.groupby_agg_builtins1
+
+will only run a ``groupby_agg_builtins1`` test defined in a ``groupby`` file.
+
+It is also useful to run tests in your current environment. You can simply do it by::
+
+    asv dev
+
+which would be equivalent to ``asv run --quick --show-stderr --python=same``. This
+will launch every test only once, display stderr from the benchmarks and use your
+local ``python'' that comes from your $PATH.
 
 Information on how to write a benchmark can be found in
 `*asv*'s documentation http://asv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing_benchmarks.html`.
