    DOC: Patch new flake8 command grep
    
    The grep was initially matching to "pandas," which is incorrect
    because that was also matching files containing "pandas" in the name
    but that were not in the main `pandas` directory (e.g. performance
    test code).  This change enforces that we match to any Python files in
    the main `pandas` directory.    Also picked up compatibility issue
    with OSX, in which the `-r` flag does not exist.  However, `xargs`
    terminates if the argument list is empty, which was the whole point of
    passing in `-r` in the first place.    Follow-up to #15712

 run this command, though it will take longer::
