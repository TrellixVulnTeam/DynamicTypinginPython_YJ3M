    DEV: Remove seed-isort-config hook (#28272)
    
    This was causing issues for me locally. Anyone else?
    
    It took a while to run, and didn't seem to give the same
    output as others (depends on something peculiar to my environment)
    which doesn't seem to be great for a pre-commit hook.
    
    Closes https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/28236
