-- Bug in ``pd.read_msgpack()`` with a non existent file is passed in Python 2 (:issue:`15296`)
-- Bug in ``DataFrame.groupby`` where key as tuple in a ``MultiIndex`` were interpreted as a list of keys (:issue:`17979`)
-- Bug in :func:`pd.read_csv` where a ``MultiIndex`` with duplicate columns was not being mangled appropriately (:issue:`18062`)
-- Bug in :func:`pd.read_sas` where a file with 0 variables gave an ``AttributeError`` incorrectly. Now it gives an ``EmptyDataError``
