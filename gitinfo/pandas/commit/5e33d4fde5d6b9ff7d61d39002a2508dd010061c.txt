+The difference between the above two variants arises because we are

+
+.. math::
+
+    y_t = \frac{x_t + (1 - \alpha)x_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha)^2 x_{t-2} + ...}

+which shows the equivalence of the above two variants for infinite series.
+When ``adjust=True`` we have :math:`y_0 = x_0` and from the last
+representation above we have :math:`y_t = \alpha x_t + (1 - \alpha) y_{t-1}`,
+therefore there is an assumption that :math:`x_0` is not an ordinary value
+but rather an exponentially weighted moment of the infinite series up to that

 One must have :math:`0 < \alpha \leq 1`, but rather than pass :math:`\alpha`
 directly, it's easier to think about either the **span**, **center of mass
 (com)** or **halflife** of an EW moment:
