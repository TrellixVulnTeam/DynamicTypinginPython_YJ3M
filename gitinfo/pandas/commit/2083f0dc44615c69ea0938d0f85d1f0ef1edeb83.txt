 Code standards
 --------------
 
+Writing good code is not just about what you write. It is also about *how* you
+write it. During testing on Travis-CI, several tools will be run to check your
+code for stylistic errors. Generating any warnings will cause the test to fail.
+Thus, good style is a requirement for submitting code to *pandas*.
+
+In addition, because a lot of people use our library, it is important that we
+do not make sudden changes to the code that could have the potential to break
+a lot of user code as a result, that is, we need it to be as *backwards compatible*
+as possible to avoid mass breakages.
+
+Additional standards are outlined on the `code style wiki
+page <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/wiki/Code-Style-and-Conventions>`_.
+
+C (cpplint)
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+*pandas* uses the `Google <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_
+standard. Google provides an open source style checker called ``cpplint``, but we
+use a fork of it that can be found `here <https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint>`_.
+Here are *some* of the more common ``cpplint`` issues:
+
+  - we restrict line-length to 80 characters to promote readability
+  - every header file must include a header guard to avoid name collisions if re-included
+
+Travis-CI will run the `cpplint <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpplint>`_ tool
+and report any stylistic errors in your code. Therefore, it is helpful before
+submitting code to run the check yourself::
+
+   cpplint --extensions=c,h --headers=h --filter=-readability/casting,-runtime/int,-build/include_subdir modified-c-file
+
+You can also run this command on an entire directory if necessary::
+
+   cpplint --extensions=c,h --headers=h --filter=-readability/casting,-runtime/int,-build/include_subdir --recursive modified-c-directory
+
+To make your commits compliant with this standard, you can install the
+`ClangFormat <http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>`_ tool, which can be
+downloaded `here <http://llvm.org/builds/>`_. To configure, in your home directory,
+run the following command::
+
+    clang-format style=google -dump-config  > .clang-format
+
+Then modify the file to ensure that any indentation width parameters are at least four.
+Once configured, you can run the tool as follows::
+
+    clang-format modified-c-file
+
+This will output what your file will look like if the changes are made, and to apply
+them, just run the following command::
+
+    clang-format -i modified-c-file
+
+To run the tool on an entire directory, you can run the following analogous commands::
+
+    clang-format modified-c-directory/*.c modified-c-directory/*.h
+    clang-format -i modified-c-directory/*.c modified-c-directory/*.h
+
+Do note that this tool is best-effort, meaning that it will try to correct as
+many errors as possible, but it may not correct *all* of them. Thus, it is
+recommended that you run ``cpplint`` to double check and make any other style
+fixes manually.
+
+Python (PEP8)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
 *pandas* uses the `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ standard.
 There are several tools to ensure you abide by this standard. Here are *some* of
 the more common ``PEP8`` issues:
 
-  - we restrict line-length to 80 characters to promote readability
+  - we restrict line-length to 79 characters to promote readability
   - passing arguments should have spaces after commas, e.g. ``foo(arg1, arg2, kw1='bar')``
 
-The Travis-CI will run `flake8 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`_ tool and report
-any stylistic errors in your code. Generating any warnings will cause the build to fail;
-thus these are part of the requirements for submitting code to *pandas*.

+Backwards Compatibility
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Please try to maintain backward compatibility. *pandas* has lots of users with lots of
 existing code, so don't break it if at all possible.  If you think breakage is required,
