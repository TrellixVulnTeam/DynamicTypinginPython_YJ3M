 The ``-E virtualenv`` option should be added to all ``asv`` commands
 that run benchmarks. The default value is defined in ``asv.conf.json``.

 If you want to only run a specific group of tests from a file, you can do it
 using ``.`` as a separator. For example::

 You can also run the benchmark suite using the version of ``pandas``
 already installed in your current Python environment. This can be
