+## Diversity and Inclusion
+
+> _pandas_ expressly welcomes and encourages contributions from anyone who faces under-representation, discrimination in the technology industry
+> or anyone willing to increase the diversity of our team.
+> We have identified visible gaps and obstacles in sustaining diversity and inclusion in the open-source communities and we are proactive in increasing
+> the diversity of our team.
+> We have a [code of conduct]({base_url}/community/coc.html) to ensure a friendly and welcoming environment.
+> Please send an email to [pandas-code-of-conduct-committee](mailto:pandas-coc@googlegroups.com), if you think we can do a
+> better job at achieving this goal.
