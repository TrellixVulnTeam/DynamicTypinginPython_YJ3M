 API changes
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 
-  - Creating a Series from another Series, passing an index, will cause
-    reindexing to happen inside rather than treating the Series like an
-    ndarray. Technically improper usages like Series(df[col1], index=df[col2])
-    that worked before "by accident" (this was never intended) will lead to all
-    NA Series in some cases.
-  - Deprecated ``day_of_year`` API removed from PeriodIndex, use ``dayofyear``
-    (GH1723_)
-  - Don't modify NumPy suppress printoption to True at import time
-  - The internal HDF5 data arrangement for DataFrames has been transposed.
-    Legacy files will still be readable by HDFStore (GH1834_, GH1824_)
-  - Legacy cruft removed: pandas.stats.misc.quantileTS
-  - Use ISO8601 format for Period repr: monthly, daily, and on down (GH1776_)
-  - Empty DataFrame columns are now created as object dtype. This will prevent
-    a class of TypeErrors that was occurring in code where the dtype of a
-    column would depend on the presence of data or not (e.g. a SQL query having
-    results) (GH1783_)
-  - Setting parts of DataFrame/Panel using ix now aligns input Series/DataFrame
-    (GH1630_)
-  - ``first`` and ``last`` methods in ``GroupBy`` no longer drop non-numeric
-    columns (GH1809_)
-  - Resolved inconsistencies in specifying custom NA values in text parser.
-    ``na_values`` of type dict no longer override default NAs unless
-    ``keep_default_na`` is set to false explicitly (GH1657_)
-  - ``DataFrame.dot`` will not do data alignment, and also work with Series
-    (GH1915_)
+  - The default column names when ``header=None`` and no columns names passed to
+    functions like ``read_csv`` has changed to be more Pythonic and amenable to
+    attribute access:
+
+.. ipython:: python
+
+   from StringIO import StringIO
+
+   data = '0,0,1\n1,1,0\n0,1,0'
+   df = read_csv(StringIO(data), header=None)
+   df

+- Creating a Series from another Series, passing an index, will cause reindexing

+  improper usages like ``Series(df[col1], index=df[col2])11 that worked before
+  "by accident" (this was never intended) will lead to all NA Series in some
+  cases. To be perfectly clear:

+.. ipython:: python
+
+   s1 = Series([1, 2, 3])
+   s1
+
+   s2 = Series(s1, index=['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])
