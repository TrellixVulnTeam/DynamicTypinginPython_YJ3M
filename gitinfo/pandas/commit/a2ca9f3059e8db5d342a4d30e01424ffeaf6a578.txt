 Highlights include:
 
-- Window functions are now methods on ``.groupby`` like objects, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0180.enhancements.moments>`.
-- ``pd.test()`` top-level nose test runner is available (:issue:`4327`)
-- Adding support for a ``RangeIndex`` as a specialized form of the ``Int64Index`` for memory savings, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0180.enhancements.rangeindex>`.
-- API breaking ``.resample`` changes to make it more ``.groupby`` like, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0180.breaking.resample>`.
-- Removal of support for deprecated float indexers; these will now raise a ``TypeError``, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0180.enhancements.float_indexers>`.
