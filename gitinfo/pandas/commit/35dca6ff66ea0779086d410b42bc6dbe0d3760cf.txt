 series-related functions in pandas.

+will continue to support the legacy time rules for the time being but it is

+Note that the legacy quarterly and annual frequencies are business quarter and
+business year ends. Also note the legacy time rule for milliseconds ``ms``
+versus the new offset alias for month start ``MS``. This means that offset
+alias parsing is case sensitive.
