+Some Linux distributions will come with a pre-installed C compiler. To find out
+which compilers (and versions) are installed on your system::
+
+    # for Debian/Ubuntu:
+    dpkg --list | grep compiler
+    # for Red Hat/RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
+    yum list installed | grep -i --color compiler
+
+`GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_, is a widely used
+compiler, which supports C and a number of other languages. If GCC is listed
+as an installed compiler nothing more is required. If no C compiler is
+installed (or you wish to install a newer version) you can install a compiler
+(GCC in the example code below) with::
+
+    # for recent Debian/Ubuntu:
+    sudo apt install build-essential
+    # for Red Had/RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
+    yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
+
+For other Linux distributions, consult your favourite search engine for
+commpiler installation instructions.
