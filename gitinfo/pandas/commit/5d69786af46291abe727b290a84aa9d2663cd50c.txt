    DOC: Clarify where to the additional arguments for some win_types
    For example, std needs to specify when win_types is gaussian. However, std should be specified in the operation argument, not as one of the rolling arguments. This change is to clarify this point.

     If ``win_type=None`` all points are evenly weighted. To learn more about
     different window types see `scipy.signal window functions
