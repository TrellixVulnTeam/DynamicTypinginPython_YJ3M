+Our Copyright Policy
+====================
+
+PyData uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
+over their contributions to PyData. However, it is important to note that
+these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
+the PyData source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
+person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
+entire PyData Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
+a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
+they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
+when they commit the change to one of the PyData repositories.
+
+With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code
+file to indicate the copyright and license terms:
