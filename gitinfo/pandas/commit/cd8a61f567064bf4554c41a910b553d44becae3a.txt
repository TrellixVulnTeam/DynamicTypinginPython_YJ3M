    ``Timedelta`` scalars (and ``TimedeltaIndex``) component fields are *not the same* as the component fields on a ``datetime.timedelta`` object. For example, ``.seconds`` on a ``datetime.timedelta`` object returns the total number of seconds combined between ``hours``, ``minutes`` and ``seconds``. In contrast, the pandas ``Timedelta`` breaks out hours, minutes, microseconds and nanoseconds separately.
