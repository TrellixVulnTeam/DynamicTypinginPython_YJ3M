    DOC: Correct and expand Series.nonzero docstring
    
    - Mention that a tuple of indices is returned and explain why.
    - Instead of numpy.ndarray.nonzero, point to numpy.nonzero, which has
      the full documentation.
    - Add example.

+        This method is equivalent to calling `numpy.nonzero` on the
+        series data. For compatability with NumPy, the return value is
+        the same (a tuple with an array of indices for each dimension),
+        but it will always be a one-item tuple because series only have
+        one dimension.
