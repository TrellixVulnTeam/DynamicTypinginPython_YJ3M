+Travis is a ci service that's well-integrated with github.
+The following ypes of breakage should be detected
+by travis builds:
+
+1) Failing tests on any supported version of python.
+2) Pandas should install and the tests should run if no optional deps are installed.
+That also means tests which rely on optional deps need to raise SkipTest()
+if the dep is missing.
+3) unicode related fails when running under exotic locales.
+
+We tried running the vbench suite for a while, but with varying load
+on travis machines, that wasn't useful.
+
+Travis currently (4/2013) has a 5-job concurrency limit. Exceeding it
+basically doubles the total runtime for a commit through travis, and
+since dep+pandas installation is already quite long, this should become
+a hard limit on concurrent travis runs.
