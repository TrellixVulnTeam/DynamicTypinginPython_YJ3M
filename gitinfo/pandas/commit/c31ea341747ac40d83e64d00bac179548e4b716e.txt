    BUG: Rename pydata to pandas-dev in merge-pr.py (#14447)
    
    * BUG: Rename pydata to pandas-dev in merge-pr
    
    The project has been renamed to pandas-dev,
    so explicitly point to the new name instead
    of relying on GitHub redirection magic.
    
    Closes gh-14439.
    
    * MAINT: merge-pr cleanup
