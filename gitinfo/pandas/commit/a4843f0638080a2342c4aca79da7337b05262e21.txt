-Comparing `Categoricals` with other objects is possible in two cases:
+Comparing categorical data with other objects is possible in three cases:
 
- * comparing a categorical Series to another categorical Series, when `categories` and `ordered` is
-   the same or
- * comparing a categorical Series to a scalar.
+ * comparing equality (``==`` and ``!=``) to a list-like object (list, Series, array,
+   ...) of the same length as the categorical data or
+ * all comparisons (``==``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, and ``<=``) of categorical data to
+   another categorical Series, when ``ordered==True`` and the `categories` are the same or
+ * all comparisons of a categorical data to a scalar.
 
-All other comparisons will raise a TypeError.
+All other comparisons, especially "non-equality" comparisons of two categoricals with different
+categories or a categorical with any list-like object, will raise a TypeError.
+
+.. note::
+
+    Any "non-equality" comparisons of categorical data with a `Series`, `np.array`, `list` or
+    categorical data with different categories or ordering will raise an `TypeError` because custom
+    categories ordering could be interpreted in two ways: one with taking in account the
+    ordering and one without.
