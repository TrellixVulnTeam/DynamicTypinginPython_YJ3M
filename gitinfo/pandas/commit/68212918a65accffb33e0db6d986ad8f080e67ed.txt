    ENH: use constant f32 eps, not np.finfo() during import
    
    NumPy docs for np.finfo() say not to call it during import (at
    module scope).  It's a relatively expensive call, and it modifies the
    GIL state.  Now we just hard-code it, because it is always the value
    anyway.  This avoids touching the GIL at import, which helps avoid
    deadlocks in practice.
