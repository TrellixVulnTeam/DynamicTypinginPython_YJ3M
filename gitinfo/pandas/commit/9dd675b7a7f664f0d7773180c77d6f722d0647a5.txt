+Google Analytics
+----------------
 
+The :mod:`~pandas.io.ga` module provides a wrapper for
+`Google Analytics API <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides>`__
+to simplify retrieving traffic data.
+Result sets are parsed into a pandas DataFrame with a shape and data types
+derived from the source table.
 
+Configuring Access to Google Analytics
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The first thing you need to do is to setup accesses to Google Analytics API. Follow the steps below:
+
+#. In the `Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`__
+    #. enable the Analytics API
+    #. create a new project
+    #. create a new Client ID for an "Installed Application" (in the "APIs & auth / Credentials section" of the newly created project)
+    #. download it (JSON file)
+#. On your machine
+    #. rename it to ``client_secrets.json``
+    #. move it to the ``pandas/io`` module directory
+
+The first time you use the :func:`read_ga` funtion, a browser window will open to ask you to authentify to the Google API. Do proceed.
+
+Using the Google Analytics API
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The following will fetch users and pageviews (metrics) data per day of the week, for the first semester of 2014, from a particular property.
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    import pandas.io.ga as ga
+    ga.read_ga(
+        account_id  = "2360420",
+        profile_id  = "19462946",
+        property_id = "UA-2360420-5",
+        metrics     = ['users', 'pageviews'],
+        dimensions  = ['dayOfWeek'],
+        start_date  = "2014-01-01",
+        end_date    = "2014-08-01",
+        index_col   = 0,
+        filters     = "pagePath=~aboutus;ga:country==France",
+    )
+
+The only mandatory arguments are ``metrics,`` ``dimensions`` and ``start_date``. We can only strongly recommend you to always specify the ``account_id``, ``profile_id`` and ``property_id`` to avoid accessing the wrong data bucket in Google Analytics.
+
+The ``index_col`` argument indicates which dimension(s) has to be taken as index.
+
+The ``filters`` argument indicates the filtering to apply to the query. In the above example, the page has URL has to contain ``aboutus`` AND the visitors country has to be France.

 - Added ability to export Categorical data to Stata (:issue:`8633`).
 - Added ability to export Categorical data to to/from HDF5 (:issue:`7621`). Queries work the same as if it was an object array. However, the ``category`` dtyped data is stored in a more efficient manner. See :ref:`here <io.hdf5-categorical>` for an example and caveats w.r.t. prior versions of pandas.
 - Added support for ``utcfromtimestamp()``, ``fromtimestamp()``, and ``combine()`` on `Timestamp` class (:issue:`5351`).
+- Added Google Analytics (`pandas.io.ga`) basic documentation (:issue:`8835`). See :ref:`here<remote_data.ga>`.
