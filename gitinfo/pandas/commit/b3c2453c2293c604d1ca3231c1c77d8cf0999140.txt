 Pandas uses C extensions (mostly written using Cython) to speed up certain
 operations. To install pandas from source, you need to compile these C
 extensions, which means you need a C compiler. This process depends on which
-platform you're using. Follow the `CPython contributing guide
-<https://devguide.python.org/setup/#compile-and-build>`_ for getting a
-compiler installed. You don't need to do any of the ``./configure`` or ``make``
-steps; you only need to install the compiler.

-For Windows developers, when using Python 3.5 and later, it is sufficient to
-install `Visual Studio 2017 <https://visualstudio.com/>`_ with the
-**Python development workload** and the **Python native development tools**
-option. Otherwise, the following links may be helpful.
