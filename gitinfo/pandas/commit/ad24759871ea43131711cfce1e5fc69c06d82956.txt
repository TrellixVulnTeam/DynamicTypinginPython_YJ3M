 the actual import is not part of the diff. Thus, for completeness, you should
 run this command, though it will take longer::

 Note that on OSX, the ``-r`` flag is not available, so you have to omit it and
 run this slightly modified command::

+Note that on Windows, these commands are unfortunately not possible because

+Alternatively, you can install the ``grep`` and ``xargs`` commands via the
