-- [ ] The PEP8 style check passes: `git diff upstream/master -u -- "*.py" | flake8 --diff`

-```
-# paste output of "scripts/validate_docstrings.py <your-function-or-method>" here
-# between the "```" (remove this comment, but keep the "```")
-
-```
-
-If the validation script still gives errors, but you think there is a good reason
-to deviate in this case (and there are certainly such cases), please state this
-explicitly.
