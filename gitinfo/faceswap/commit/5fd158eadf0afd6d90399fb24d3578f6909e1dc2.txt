 We are very troubled by the fact that faceswap can be used for unethical and disreputable things. However, we support the development of tools and techniques that can be used ethically as well as provide education and experience in AI for anyone who wants to learn it hands-on. We will take a zero tolerance approach to anyone using this software for any unethical purposes and will actively discourage any such uses.
 
+## How To setup and run the project
+Faceswap is a Python program that will run on multiple Operating Systems including Windows, Linux and MacOS.
+
+See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for full installation instructions. You will need a modern GPU with CUDA support for best performance.

 ### Extract
 From your setup folder, run `python faceswap.py extract`. This will take photos from `src` folder and extract faces into `extract` folder.

-## How To setup and run the project
-
-### Setup
-Clone the repo and setup you environment.
-
-You can either use the docker image or run `python setup.py`
-
-Check out [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for more detailed instructions and basic information on how to configure virtualenv.
-
-You also need a modern GPU with CUDA support for best performance
-
 **Some tips:**
 
 Reusing existing models will train much faster than starting from nothing.  
 If there is not enough training data, start with someone who looks similar, then switch the data.
 
+## Help I need support!
+### Discord Server
+Your best bet is to join the [Faceswap Discord server](https://discord.gg/FdEwxXd) where there are plenty of users willing to help. Please note that, like this repo, this is a SFW Server!
