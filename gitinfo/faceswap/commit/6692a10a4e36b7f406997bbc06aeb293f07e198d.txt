    Fix issue with frame-range (#94)
    
    * extended arguments for convert re https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/issues/85
    
    * forgot to change helptext for extended arguments.
    
    * Added -fr --frame-range argument to convert
    
    accepts a list of frame ranges like `-fr 40-50 90-100`
    
    still writes out frames that havent been converted.
    
    * added --discard-frames argument
    
    --discard-frames discards frames not included in --frame-range instead
    of writing them out unchanged.
    
    * Made training message slightly clearer
    
    * Revert "Made training message slightly clearer"
    
    This reverts commit 25a9744aea444a67a4825ec86d06357b31a43c9d.
    
    * Training status now '\r's rather than newlines.
    Maybe its good, maybe its bad.
    I like it.
    
    * fixing https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/pull/90#issuecomment-362309166
