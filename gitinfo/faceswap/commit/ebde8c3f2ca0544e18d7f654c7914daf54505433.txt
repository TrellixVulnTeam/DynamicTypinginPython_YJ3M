 Windows now has an installer which installs everything for you and creates a desktop shortcut to launch straight into the GUI. You can download the installer from https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/releases.

 ## Manual Install
 
-Setting up Faceswap can seem a little intimidating to new users, but it isn't that complicated, although a little time consuming. It is recommended to use Linux where possible as Windows will hog about 20% of your GPU Memory, making Faceswap run a little slower, however using Windows is perfectly fine and 100% supported.

 It's good to keep faceswap up to date as new features are added and bugs are fixed. To do so:

 # General Install Guide
 ## Installing dependencies
-- Python >= 3.2-3.7 64-bit
-  - apt/yum install python3 (Linux)
-  - [Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) (Windows)
-  - [brew](https://brew.sh/) install python3 (macOS)
+### Git
+Git is required for obtaining the code and keeping your codebase up to date.
+Obtain git for your distribution from the [git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
+
+### Python
+The recommended install method is to use a Conda3 Environment as this will handle the installation of Nvidia's CUDA and cuDNN straight into your Conda Environment.
+  - [MiniConda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
+  
+Alternatively you can install Python (>= 3.2-3.7 64-bit) for your distribution (links below.) If you go down this route and are using an Nvidia GPU you should install CUDA (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) and cuDNN (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). for your system. If you do not plan to build Tensorflow yourself, make sure you install no higher than version 10.0 of CUDA and 7.5.x of CUDNN.
+  - Python distributions:
+    - apt/yum install python3 (Linux)
+    - [Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) (Windows)
+    - [brew](https://brew.sh/) install python3 (macOS)
+
+### Virtual Environment
+  It is highly recommended that you setup faceswap inside a virtual environment. In fact we will not generally support installations that are not within a virtual environment as troubleshooting package conflicts can be next to impossible.
+
+  If using Conda3 then setting up virtual environments is relatively straight forward. More information can be found at [Conda Docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
+
+  If using a default Python distribution then [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io) may help when you are not using docker.

 ## Getting the faceswap code
-Simply download the code from http://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap - For development, it is recommended to use git instead of downloading the code and extracting it.
+It is recommended to clone the repo with git instead of downloading the code from http://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap and extracting it as this will make it far easier to get the latest code (which can be done from the GUI). To clone a repo you can either use the Git GUI for your distribution or open up a command prompt, enter the folder where you want to store faceswap and enter:
+```bash
+git clone https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap.git
+```
 
-For now, extract the code to a directory where you're comfortable working with it. Navigate to it with the command line. For our example, we will use `~/faceswap/` as our project directory.
