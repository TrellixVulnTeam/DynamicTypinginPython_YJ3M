 # Windows Install Guide
+
+## Installer
+Windows now has an installer which installs everything for you and creates a desktop shortcut to launch straight into the GUI. You can download the installer from https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/releases.
+
+If you have issues with the installer then read on for the more manual way to install Faceswap on Windows.
+
+## Manual Install
+
 Setting up Faceswap can seem a little intimidating to new users, but it isn't that complicated, although a little time consuming. It is recommended to use Linux where possible as Windows will hog about 20% of your GPU Memory, making Faceswap run a little slower, however using Windows is perfectly fine and 100% supported.
