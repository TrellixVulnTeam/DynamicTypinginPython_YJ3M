+# About github.com/deepfakes
+
+## What is this repo?
+It is a fan-made repo for active users.
+
+## Why this repo?
+The joshua-wu repo seems not active. Simple bugs like missing _http://_ in front of url has not been solved since days.
+
+## Why is it named 'deepfakes' if it is not /u/deepfakes?
+ 1. Because a typosquat would have happened sooner or later as project grows
+ 2. Because all glory go to /u/deepfakes
+ 3. Because it will better federate contributors and users
+ 
+## What if /u/deepfakes feels bad about that?
+This is a friendly typosquat, and it is fully dedicated to the project. If /u/deepfakes wants to take over this repo/user and drive the project, he is welcomed to do so (Raise an issue, and he will be contacted on Reddit).
