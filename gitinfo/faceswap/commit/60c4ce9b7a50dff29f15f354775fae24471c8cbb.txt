+If you prefer using Docker, You can start the project with:
+ - Build: `docker build -t deepfakes .`
+ - Run: `docker run --rm --name deepfakes -v [src_folder]:/srv -it deepfakes bash` . `bash` can be replaced by your command line 
+Note that the Dockerfile does not have all good requirments, so it will fail on some python 3 commands.
+Also note that it does not have a GUI output, so the train.py will fail on showing image. You can comment this, or save it as a file.
