+### Versioning Policy
+This repository adheres to [semver](https://semver.org/). The following policy is in effect for `dash`, `dash-core-components`, `dash-html-components` and `dash-renderer`:
+1. Matching major version numbers are guarenteed to work together.
+2. Any change to the public API (breaking change) will increase a major version.
+
+1 and 2 imply that when any core `dash*` repo introduces a breaking change all `dash*` repos will increment their major versions to match. The process for accomplishing this process is called a **major release candidate window** and is outlined below.
+
+### Major Release Candidate Window
+1. The major release candidate window will be announced internally at Plotly and through our popular community channels.
+2. Within one day `dash`, `dash-core-components`, `dash-html-components` and `dash-renderer` master branches will be reversioned as `N.0.0-rc1` and published.
+3. Pull requests especially those containing breaking changes will be merged.
+4. Per repo tests will be updated to target the latest `rc` versions.
+5. [dash-docs](https://github.com/plotly/dash-docs), some apps in the [dash gallery](https://dash.plot.ly/gallery) and Plotly internal projects will be updated to target the latest `rc` versions.
+6. steps 3-5 will continue until all breaking changes have been merged.
+7. A major release candidate freeze will go into effect. During this time steps 3-5 will continue but only bug fixes will be merged.
+8. Within one day `dash`, `dash-core-components`, `dash-html-components` and `dash-renderer` master branches will be reversioned as `N.0.0` and published ending the major release cnadidate window.
+
+### Backporting fixes
+During and after the major release candidate window bug fixes that can apply to pre-major release candidate releases should be backported. This is accomplished by:
+1. If a pre-major release branch does not exist then check out a branch at the tag defining the last published release before the previous major release candidate window began. For example if we are in the `1.x` series and the last pre-`1.x` series release is `0.18.1` checkout a branch at `0.18.1` called `0.18-release`. If the branch does exist check it out.
+2. Cherry-pick or otherwise reapply the fix to the pre-major release branch and update the patch version. In the example above the new version will be `0.18.2` on the `0.18-release` branch.
+3. Publish.
