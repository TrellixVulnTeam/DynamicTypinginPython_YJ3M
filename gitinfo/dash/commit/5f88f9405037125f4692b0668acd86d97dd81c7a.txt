 - [#753](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/753) `Component` no longer inherits `MutableMapping`, so `values`, `keys`, and more are no longer methods. Fixes an issue reported in [dcc#440](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/440) where components with certain prop names defined but not provided would cause a failure to render. During component generation we now disallow all props with leading underscores or matching a few remaining reserved words: `UNDEFINED`, `REQUIRED`, `to_plotly_json`, `available_properties`, and `available_wildcard_properties`.

 We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) as our test automation framework, plus [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for a few renderer unit tests. You can `npm run test` to run them all, but this command simply runs `pytest` with no arguments, then `cd dash-renderer && npm run test` for the renderer unit tests.

 ### Integration Tests
 
-We introduced the `dash.testing` feature in [Dash 1.0](https://community.plotly.com/t/announcing-dash-testing/24868). It makes writing a Dash integration test much easier. Please read the [tutorial](http://dash.plotly.com/testing) and add relevant integration tests with any new features or bug fixes.
