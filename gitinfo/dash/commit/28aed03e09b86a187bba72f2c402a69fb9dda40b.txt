+dash is a generic, web-based API for assembling modular components into dynamic web applications.
+
+similar projects include:
+- R's Shiny
+- Jupyter Widgets
+- Plotly's [dashboards.ly](https://dashboards.ly)
+
+dash is composed of several parts:
+- a JSON API that describes the layout and composition of the web applications
+- an HTTP API that specifies how components depend on each other and how components should update when the front-end state changes
+- a front-end implementation of these APIs written with React and redux
+- a back-end implementation of the HTTP API written with Python and Flask
+- a web-based user interface for creating, editing, and re-arranging these layouts written in React
+
+this repo contains prototypes of these components.
