 ### Fixed
 - [#1249](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1249) Fixes [#919](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/919) so `dash.testing` is compatible with more `pytest` plugins, particularly `pytest-flake8` and `pytest-black`.
 - [#1248](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1248) Fixes [#1245](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/1245), so you can use prop persistence with components that have dict IDs, ie for pattern-matching callbacks.
+- [#1185](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1185) Sort asset directories, same as we sort files inside those directories. This way if you need your assets loaded in a certain order, you can add prefixes to subdirectory names and enforce that order.
