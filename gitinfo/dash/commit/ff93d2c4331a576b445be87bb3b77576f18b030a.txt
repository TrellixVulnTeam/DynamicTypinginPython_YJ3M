-- `component_loader` now has the following behavior to create docstrings
-as determined in discussion in [#187](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/187):
-    1. If a Dash component has `PropTypes`-generated typing, the docstring uses the `PropTypes`, _regardless of whether the component also has Flow types (current behavior)._
-    2. Otherwise if a Dash component has Flow types but _not `PropTypes`_, the docstring now uses the objects generated by `react-docgen` from the Flow types.
