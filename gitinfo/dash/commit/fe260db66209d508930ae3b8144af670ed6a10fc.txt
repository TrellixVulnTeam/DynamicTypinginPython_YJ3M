 - [#753](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/753) `Component` no longer inherits `MutableMapping`, so `values`, `keys`, and more are no longer methods. Fixes an issue reported in [dcc#440](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/440) where components with certain prop names defined but not provided would cause a failure to render. During component generation we now disallow all props with leading underscores or matching a few remaining reserved words: `UNDEFINED`, `REQUIRED`, `to_plotly_json`, `available_properties`, and `available_wildcard_properties`.
