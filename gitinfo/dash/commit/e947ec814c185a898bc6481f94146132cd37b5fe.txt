 - [#739](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/739) Allow the Flask app to be provided to Dash after object initialization. This allows users to define Dash layouts etc when using the app factory pattern, or any other pattern that inhibits access to the app object. This broadly complies with the flask extension API, allowing Dash to be considered as a Flask extension where it needs to be.
 
+- [#774](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/774) Allow the Flask app to set the Dash app name if the name is not provided by users.

 - [#722](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/722) Assets are served locally by default. Both JS scripts and CSS files are affected. This improves robustness and flexibility in numerous situations, but in certain cases initial loading could be slowed. To restore the previous CDN serving, set `app.scripts.config.serve_locally = False` (and similarly with `app.css`, but this is generally less important).
 
 - Undo/redo toolbar is removed by default, you can enable it with `app=Dash(show_undo_redo=true)`. The CSS hack `._dash-undo-redo:{display:none;}` is no longer needed [#724](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/724)
