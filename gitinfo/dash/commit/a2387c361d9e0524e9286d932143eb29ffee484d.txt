 ### Fixed
+- [#1212](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1212) Fixes [#1200](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/1200) - prior to Dash 1.11, if none of the inputs to a callback were on the page, it was not an error. This was, and is now again, treated as though the callback raised PreventUpdate. The one exception to this is with pattern-matching callbacks, when every Input uses a multi-value wildcard (ALL or ALLSMALLER), and every Output is on the page. In that case the callback fires as usual.
 - [#1201](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1201) Fixes [#1193](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/1193) - prior to Dash 1.11, you could use `flask.has_request_context() == False` inside an `app.layout` function to provide a special layout containing all IDs for validation purposes in a multi-page app. Dash 1.11 broke this when we moved most of this validation into the renderer. This change makes it work again.
