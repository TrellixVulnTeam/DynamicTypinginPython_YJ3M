 ## [0.11.1] - 2017-10-19
 ### Fixed
 - :snail: :racehorse: Fixed a performance issue. In 0.11.0 we introduced an  internal request queue to fix some bugs. This request queue was boundless and in certain cases it could become really large and slow down the app. Now, we remove old requests from this queue when they are no longer needed, keeping its size under control.
