    :tada: Include newly minted `Dash` framework
    
    `Framework :: Dash` is now an official PyPI trove classifier. See https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/6273 for the great community-led effort to make this possible.
    
    Published Dash-related packages that have this classifier can be found on PyPI at https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Dash.
