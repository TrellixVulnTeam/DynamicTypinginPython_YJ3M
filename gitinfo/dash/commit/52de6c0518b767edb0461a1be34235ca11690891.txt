 When a change in renderer code doesn't reflect in your browser as expected, this could be: confused bundle generation, caching issue in a browser, python package not in `editable` mode, etc. The new tool reduces the risk of bundle assets by adding the digest to help compare asset changes.
 
+## Python 2 And 3 Compatibility
+
+Writing Python 2/3 compatible code might be a challenging task for contributors used to working on one particular version, especially new learners who start directly with Python 3.
+
+From the #892, we started to adopt  `python-future`  instead of  `six`  as our tool to better achieve the goal where we can mainly write Python 3 code and make it back-compatible in Python 2.7 (last Python 2 version Dash supports before it gets deprecated).

+Please refer to [this list of idioms](https://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html "https://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html")  whenever you doubt this topic.
