 ### Changed
 - [#1237](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1237) Closes [#920](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/920): Converts hot reload fetch failures into a server status indicator showing whether the latest fetch succeeded or failed. Callback fetch failures still appear as errors but have a clearer message.
 
+### Fixed
+- [#1249](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1249) Fixes [#919](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/919) so `dash.testing` is compatible with more `pytest` plugins, particularly `pytest-flake8` and `pytest-black`.

 ## [1.12.0] - 2020-05-05
 ### Added
 - [#1228](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1228) Adds control over firing callbacks on page (or layout chunk) load. Individual callbacks can have their initial calls disabled in their definition `@app.callback(..., prevent_initial_call=True)` and similar for `app.clientside_callback`. The app-wide default can also be changed with `app=Dash(prevent_initial_callbacks=True)`, then individual callbacks may disable this behavior.
