+## [0.13.1] - 2018-07-18
+### Fixed
+- If a callback references an `id` which does not exist in the DOM tree at the time it is executed, throw an informative front-end exception (previously an uninformative front-end exception was thrown). https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/57
+
 ## [0.13.0] - 2018-06-01
 ### Fixed
 - Previously, if a component called `updateProps` with multiple properties, Dash would fire the callback multiple times (once for each property). Now, the callback is only fired once. https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/54
