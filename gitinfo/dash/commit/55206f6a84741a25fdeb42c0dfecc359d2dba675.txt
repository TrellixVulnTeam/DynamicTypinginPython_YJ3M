 ### Removed
 - Remove unofficial support for `/routes`. This was never officially supported and was an antipattern in Dash. URLs and multi-page apps can be specified natively through the `dash_core_components.Link` and `dash_core_components.Location` components. See [https://plot.ly/dash/urls](https://plot.ly/dash/urls) for more details.

 ### Added
 - Added a class `_dash-undo-redo` to the undo/redo toolbar. This allows the undo/redo to be styled (or even removed)
