+# Change Log for Dash
+All notable changes `dash` will be documented in this file.
+This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
+
+## Unreleased
+### Added
+- [#944](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/944)
+  - Relevant `dash.testing` methods can now be called with either an element or a CSS selector: `select_dcc_dropdown`, `multiple_click`, `clear_input`, `zoom_in_graph_by_ratio`, `click_at_coord_fractions`.
+  - Three new `dash.testing` methods: `clear_local_storage`, `clear_session_storage`, and `clear_storage` (to clear both together)
+- [#937](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/937) `dash.testing` adds two APIs `zoom_in_graph_by_ratio` and `click_at_coord_fractions` about advanced interactions using mouse `ActionChain`
+- [#938](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/938) Add debugging traces to dash backend about serving component suites, to verify the installed packages whenever in doubt.
+
+### Fixed
+- [#944](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/944) Fix a bug with persistence being toggled on/off on an existing component.
+
+## [1.3.1] - 2019-09-19
+### Changed
+- Bump dash-core-components version from 1.2.0 to [1.2.1](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#120---2019-09-19)
+
+## [1.3.0] - 2019-09-17
+### Added
+- [#923](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/923) Add one configuration `--percy-assets` in `pytest` to specify extra application assets path if needed.
+
+- [#918](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/918) Add `wait_for_element_by_id` and `visit_and_snapshot` APIs in browser, add `raw_command` option (with higher priority than the default waitress one) and optional `start_timeout` argument to handle large applications within the process runner.
+
+- [#903](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/903) Persistence: enable props edited by the user to persist across recreating the component or reloading the page. Components need to define three new props: `persistence`, `persisted_props`, and `persistence_type` as described in the lead comment of `src/persistence.js`. App developers then enable this behavior by, in the simplest case, setting `persistence: true` on the component. First use case is table, see [dash-table#566](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/566)
+
+### Changed
+- Bump dash-table version from 4.2.0 to [4.3.0](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#430---2019-09-17)
+- Bump dash-core-components version from 1.1.2 to [1.2.0](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#120---2019-09-17)
+- Bump dash-renderer version from 1.0.1 to [1.1.0](https://github.com/plotly/dash/blob/master/dash-renderer/CHANGELOG.md#110---2019-09-17)
+
+### Fixed
+- [#915](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/915) Fix `dash-generate-components` on Windows.
+- [#829](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/829) Fix the `--remote` pytest argument which was not effective in the code, adding a new argument `--remote-url` to support the selenium grid usage in the cloud.
+- Reduce the dash-renderer packages size on **PyPI** about 55% by removing the source maps. To do more advanced debugging, the source maps needs to be generated from source code with `npm run build:local` and pip install in editable mode, i.e. `pip install -e .` [#910](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/910)
+
+## [1.2.0] - 2019-08-27
+### Added
+- [#860](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/860) Add a new arg `dev_tools_prune_errors` to `app.run_server` and `app.enable_dev_tools`. Default `True`, tracebacks only include user code and below. Set it `False` for the previous behavior showing all the Dash and Flask parts of the stack.
+

+
+### Fixed
+- [#874](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/874) Clean all the binary assets in dash-renderer, add tool to build all the required bundles from fresh source code to avoid confusion of the assets and improve the release process. Fixes [#868](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/868) and [#734](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/734)
+
+## [1.1.1] - 2019-08-06
+### Changed

+- Bump dash-core-components version from 1.0.0 to [1.1.0](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#110---2019-08-05)
+
+## [1.0.2] - 2019-07-15
+### Changed
+- Bump dash-table version from 4.0.1 to [4.0.2](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#402---2019-07-15)
+
+### Fixed
+- [#821](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/821) Fix a bug with callback error reporting, [#791](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/791).
+
+## [1.0.1] - 2019-07-09
+### Changed
+- 💥 [#808](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/808) Remove strong `dash.testing` dependencies per community feedback. Testing users should do `pip install dash[testing]` afterwards.
+
+- [#805](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/805) Add headless mode for dash.testing, add `pytest_setup_options` hook for full configuration of `WebDriver Options`.
+
+- Bump dash-table version from 4.0.0 to [4.0.1](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#401---2019-07-09)
+
+## [1.0.0] - 2019-06-20
+### Changed
+- 💥 [#761](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/761) Several breaking changes to the `dash.Dash` API:
+  - Remove two obsolete constructor kwargs: `static_folder` and `components_cache_max_age`
+  - Remove the misspelled `supress_callback_exceptions` fallback
+  - Remove the unused `resources.config.infer_from_layout`
+  - Revamp `app.config`: ALL constructor args are now stored in `config`, with three exceptions: `server`, `index_string`, and `plugins`. None of these are stored in any other instance attributes anymore.
+  - Change `hot_reload_interval` from msec to seconds, for consistency with `hot_reload_watch_interval`
+  - When called from `enable_dev_tools`, `debug=True` by default. It's still `False` by default from `run_server`.
+
+- ✨ [#744](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/744) Introducing Dash Testing (`dash.testing`) - read the full tutorial at http://dash.plot.ly/testing.
+
+- [#753](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/753) `Component` no longer inherits `MutableMapping`, so `values`, `keys`, and more are no longer methods. Fixes an issue reported in [dcc#440](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/440) where components with certain prop names defined but not provided would cause a failure to render. During component generation we now disallow all props with leading underscores or matching a few remaining reserved words: `UNDEFINED`, `REQUIRED`, `to_plotly_json`, `available_properties`, and `available_wildcard_properties`.
+
+- [#739](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/739) Allow the Flask app to be provided to Dash after object initialization. This allows users to define Dash layouts etc when using the app factory pattern, or any other pattern that inhibits access to the app object. This broadly complies with the flask extension API, allowing Dash to be considered as a Flask extension where it needs to be.
+
+- [#774](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/774) Allow the Flask app to set the Dash app name if the name is not provided by users.
+
+- [#722](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/722) Assets are served locally by default. Both JS scripts and CSS files are affected. This improves robustness and flexibility in numerous situations, but in certain cases initial loading could be slowed. To restore the previous CDN serving, set `app.scripts.config.serve_locally = False` (and similarly with `app.css`, but this is generally less important).
+
+- Undo/redo toolbar is removed by default, you can enable it with `app=Dash(show_undo_redo=true)`. The CSS hack `._dash-undo-redo:{display:none;}` is no longer needed [#724](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/724), [renderer#175](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/175)
+
+- 💥[#709](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/709) Merge the `dash-renderer` project into the main dash repo to simplify feature dev workflow. We will keep the [deprecated one](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer) for archive purpose.
+
+## [0.43.0] - 2019-05-15
+### Changed
+- Bump dash-core-components version from 0.47.0 to [0.48.0](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0480---2019-05-15)

+- [#387](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/387) Add `Cache-Control` headers to files served by `Dash.serve_component_suites`, and time modified query string to collected components suites resources.
+- [#394](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/394) Add `InvalidResourceError` error and a Flask error handler so unregistered paths in `serve_component_suites` return a 404 instead of 500.
+
+## 0.26.5 - 2018-09-10
+### Fixed
+- [#374](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/374) Fix `get_asset_url` with a different `assets_url_path`.
+
+## 0.26.4 - 2018-08-28
+### Fixed
+- Set `url_base_pathname` to `None` in `Dash.__init__`. Fix [#364](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/364)
+
+## 0.26.3 - 2018-08-27
+### Added
+- `Dash.get_asset_url` will give the prefixed url for the asset file.
+
+### Fixed
+- [#351](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/351) Prefix assets files with `requests_pathname_prefix`.
+
+## 0.26.2 - 2018-08-26
+### Fixed
+- [#343](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/343) Only create the assets blueprint once for apps that provide the same flask instance to multiple dash instances.
+
+## 0.26.1 - 2018-08-26
+### Fixed
+- [#336](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/336) Fix bug in `_validate_layout` which would not let a user set `app.layout` to be a function that returns a layout [(fixes #334)](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/334).
+
+## 0.26.0 - 2018-08-20
+### Added
+- [#318](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/318) Add `assets_ignore` init keyword, regex filter for the assets files.
+
+## 0.25.1 - 2018-08-20
+### Fixed
+- [#335](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/335) Ensure CSS/JS external resources are loaded before the assets.
+
+## 0.25.0 - 2018-08-14
+### Added
+- [#322](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/322) Take config values from init or environ variables (Prefixed with `DASH_`).
+
+### Fixed
+- Take `requests_pathname_prefix` config when creating scripts tags.
+- `requests/routes_pathname_prefix` must start and end with `/`.
+- `requests_pathname_prefix` must end with `routes_pathname_prefix`. If you supplied both `requests` and `routes` pathname before this update, make sure `requests_pathname_prefix` ends with the same value as `routes_pathname_prefix`.
+- `url_base_pathname` sets both `requests/routes` pathname, cannot supply it with either `requests` or `routes` pathname prefixes.
+
+
+## 0.24.2 - 2018-08-13
+### Fixed
+- [#320](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/320) Disallow duplicate component ids in the initial layout.
+
+## 0.24.1 - 2018-08-10
+### Fixed
+- Fix bug [#321](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/321) where importing Dash components with no props would result in an error.
+- Fix a bug in 0.23.1 where importing components with arguments that are python keywords could cause an error. In particular, this fixes `dash-html-components` with Python 3.7.
+
+## 0.24.0 - 2018-08-10
+### Added
+- [#319](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/309) Add a modified time query string to assets included in the index in order to bust the cache.
+
+
+## 0.23.1 - 2018-08-02
+### Added
+- [#316](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/316) Add `ie-compat` meta tag to the index by default.
+- [#305](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/305) Add `external_script` and `external_css` keywords to dash `__init__`.
+- Dash components are now generated at build-time and then imported rather than generated when a module is imported. This should reduce the time it takes to import Dash component libraries, and makes Dash compatible with IDEs.
+
+## 0.22.1 - 2018-08-01
+### Fixed
+- [#273](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/273) Raise a more informative error if a non-JSON-serializable value is returned from a callback.
+
+## 0.22.0 - 2018-07-25
+### Added
+- [#286](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/286) Asset files & index customization.
+- [#294](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/294) Raise an error if there is no layout present when the server is run.
+- [renderer#55](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/55) Add `_dash-error` class to the "Error loading layout" and "Error loading dependencies" messages.
+
+### Fixed
+- Attempting to render a `Boolean` value to the page no longer crashes the app.
+- [renderer#57](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/57) If a callback references an `id` which does not exist in the DOM tree at the time it is executed, throw a more informative front-end exception.
+- [renderer#54](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/54) Previously, if a component called `updateProps` with multiple properties, Dash would fire the callback multiple times (once for each property). Now the callback only fires once.
+
+## 0.21.1 - 2018-04-10
+### Added
+- [#237](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/237) Support `aria-*` and `data-*` attributes in all dash html components. These new keywords can be added using a dictionary expansion, e.g. `html.Div(id="my-div", **{"data-toggle": "toggled", "aria-toggled": "true"})`
+- [renderer#45](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/45) Allow user to choose between React versions '15.4.2' and '16.2.0':
+```python
+import dash_renderer
+
+# Set the react version before setting up the Dash application
+dash_renderer._set_react_version('16.2.0')
+
+app = dash.Dash(...)
+```
+
+### Fixed
+- [renderer#50](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/50) Update MANIFEST.in to include `react` and `react-dom` bundles for development mode
+
+## 0.21.0 - 2018-02-21
+### Added
+- [#207](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/207) Support React components using [Flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/) types. `component_loader` now has the following behavior to create docstrings as determined in discussion in [#187](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/187):
+  1. If a Dash component has `PropTypes`-generated typing, the docstring uses the `PropTypes`, _regardless of whether the component also has Flow types (current behavior)._
+  2. Otherwise if a Dash component has Flow types but _not `PropTypes`_, the docstring now uses the objects generated by `react-docgen` from the Flow types.
+
+### Fixed
+- [renderer#42](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/42) Fix [renderer#41](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/41) and [renderer#44](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/44).
+  - In some cases, during initialization, callbacks may fired multiple times instead of just once. This only happens in certain scenarios where outputs have overlapping inputs and those inputs are leaves (they don't have any inputs of their own).
+  - If an output component is returned from a callback and its inputs were _not_ returned from the same input (i.e. they were already visible), then the callback to update the output would not fire. This has now been fixed. A common scenario where this app structure exists is within a Tabbed app, where there are global controls that update each tab's contents and the tab's callback just displays new output containers.
+
+## 0.20.0 - 2018-01-19
+### Added
+- [#190](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/190) `exceptions.PreventUpdate` can be raised inside a callback to prevent the callback from updating the app. See https://community.plot.ly/t/improving-handling-of-aborted-callbacks/7536/2.
+
+### Removed
+- Removes logging from redux middleware from production build based on process.env.NODE_ENV.
+
+### Changed
+- Many pylint style fixes: [#163](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/163), [#164](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/164), [#165](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/165), [#166](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/166), [#167](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/167), [#168](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/168), [#169](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/169), [#172](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/172), [#173](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/173), [#181](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/181), [#185](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/185), [#186](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/186), [#193](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/193)
+- [#184](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/184) New integration test framework.
+- [#174](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/174) Submodules are now imported into the `dash` namespace for better IDE completion.
+
+## 0.19.0 - 2017-10-16
+### Changed
+- 🔒  Remove CSRF protection measures. CSRF-style attacks are not relevant to Dash apps. Dash's API uses `POST` requests with content type `application/json` which are not susceptible to unwanted requests from 3rd party sites. See [#141](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/141).
+- 🔒  `app.server.secret_key` is no longer required since CSRF protection was removed. Setting `app.server.secret_key` was difficult to document and a very common source of confusion, so it's great that users won't get bitten by this anymore :tada:
+- 🐞 [renderer#22](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/22), [renderer#28](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/28) Previously, old requests could override new requests if their response was longer than the new one. This caused subtle bugs when apps are deployed on multiple processes or threads with component callbacks that update at varying rates like urls. Originally reported in [#133](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/133). This fix should also improve performance when many updates happen at once as outdated requests will get dropped instead of updating the UI. Performance issue with the first PR reported in [renderer#27](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/27) and fixed in the second PR.
+- [renderer#21](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/21) Fix an issue where a callback would be fired excessively. Previously, the callback would be called as many times as it had inputs. Now, it is called less.
+
+## 0.18.3 - 2017-09-08
+### Added
+- `app.config` is now a `dict` instead of a class. You can set config variables with `app.config['suppress_callback_exceptions'] = True` now. The previous class-based syntax (e.g. `app.config.suppress_callback_exceptions`) has been maintained for backwards compatibility.
+- 🐌 Experimental behaviour for a customizable "loading state". When a callback is in motion, Dash now appends a `<div class="_dash-loading-callback"/>` to the DOM. Users can style this element using custom CSS to display loading screen overlays. This feature is in alpha, we may remove it at any time.
+
+### Fixed
+- Fix a bug from 0.18.2 that removed the ability for dash to serve the app on any route besides `/`.
+- Fix a bug from 0.18.0 with the new config variables when used in a multi-app setting, causing config to be shared across apps. Originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/flask-endpoint-error/5691/7
+- Rename config setting `supress_callback_exceptions` to `suppress_callback_exceptions`. The original spelling is kept for backward compatibility.
+- 🐞 (renderer) Fix a bug where Dash would fire updates for each parent of a grandchild node that shared the same grandparent. Originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/specifying-dependency-tree-traversal/5080/5
+- 🐞 (renderer) Fix a bug where the document title that displays "Updating..." wouldn't change if the callback raised an Exception. Now it will be removed on any response, even a failure.
+
+## 0.18.2 - 2017-09-07
+### Added
+- [#70](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/70) 🔧 Add an `endpoint` to each of the URLs to allow for multiple routes.
+
+## 0.18.1 - 2017-09-07
+### Fixed
+- [#128](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/128) 🐛 If `app.layout` is a function, then it used to be called excessively. Now it is called just once on startup and just once on page load.
+
+## 0.18.0 - 2017-09-07
+### Changed
+- 🔒  Remove the `/static/` folder and endpoint that is implicitly initialized by flask. This is too implicit for my comfort level: I worry that users will not be aware that their files in their `static` folder are accessible
+- ⚡️  Remove all API calls to the Plotly API (https://api.plot.ly/), the authentication endpoints and decorators, and the associated `filename`, `sharing` and `app_url` arguments. This was never documented or officially supported. Authentication has been moved to the [`dash-auth` package](https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth).
+- [#107](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/107) ✏️ Sort prop names in exception messages.
+
+### Added
+- 🔧 Add two new `config` variables: `routes_pathname_prefix` and `requests_pathname_prefix` to provide more flexibility for API routing when Dash apps are run behind proxy servers. `routes_pathname_prefix` is a prefix applied to the backend routes and `requests_pathname_prefix` prefixed in requests made by Dash's front-end. `dash-renderer==0.8.0rc3` uses these endpoints.
+- [#112](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/112) 🔧 Add `id` to `KeyError` exceptions in components.
+
+
+### Fixed
+- ✏️  Fix a typo in an exception.
+- 🔧 Replaced all illegal characters in environment variables.
+
+### 🔧 Maintenance
+- 📝  Update README.md
+- ✅  Fix CircleCI tests. Note that the [`dash-renderer`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer) contains the bulk of the integration tests.
+- 💄 Flake8 fixes and tests (fixes [#99](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/99))
+- ✨ Added this CHANGELOG.md.
+
+## 0.17.3 - 2017-06-22
+✨ This is the initial open-source release of Dash.

-# Change Log for dash-renderer
-All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
-This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
-
-# Unreleased
-### Fixed
-- [#944](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/944) fixed bug with persistence being toggled on/off on an existing component
-
-## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-17
-### Added
-- [#903](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/903) enables props edited by the user to persist across recreating the component or reloading the page. Components need to define three new props: `persistence`, `persisted_props`, and `persistence_type` as described in the lead comment of `src/persistence.js`. App developers then enable this behavior by, in the simplest case, setting `persistence: true` on the component. First use case is table, see [dash-table#566](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/566)
-
-### Fixed
-- Reduced about 55% of the dash-renderer packages size on **PyPI** by removing the source maps. To do more advanced debugging, the source maps needs to be generated from source code with `npm run build:local` and pip install in editable mode, i.e. `pip install -e .` [#910](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/910)
-
-## [1.0.1] - 2019-08-27

-
-## [1.0.0] - 2019-06-20
-### Changed
-- Undo/redo toolbar is removed by default, unless `config.show_undo_redo=true` is provided. The CSS hack `._dash-undo-redo:{display:none;}` is no longer needed [#175](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/175)

-
-## [0.13.1] - 2018-07-18
-### Fixed
-- If a callback references an `id` which does not exist in the DOM tree at the time it is executed, throw an informative front-end exception (previously an uninformative front-end exception was thrown). https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/57
-
-## [0.13.0] - 2018-06-01
-### Fixed
-- Previously, if a component called `updateProps` with multiple properties, Dash would fire the callback multiple times (once for each property). Now, the callback is only fired once. https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/54
-
-
-### Added
-- A `_dash-error` class was added to the "Error loading layout" and "Error loading dependencies" messages. https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/55

-## [0.12.1] - 2018-03-29
-### Fixed
-- Updates MANIFEST.in to include react and react-dom bundles for development mode
-https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/50
-
-## [0.12.0] - 2018-03-28
-### Added
-- Allows user to now choose between '15.4.2' and '16.2.0' for React versions
-```python
-import dash_renderer
-
-# Set the react version before setting up the Dash application
-dash_renderer._set_react_version('16.2.0')
-
-app = dash.Dash(...)
-```
-https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/45
-
-## [0.11.3] - 2018-02-01
-### Fixed
-- Fixed #41 in #42. In some cases, during initialization, callbacks may fired multiple times instead of just once. This only happens in certain scenarios where outputs have overlapping inputs and those inputs are leaves (they don't have any inputs of their own). See #41 for a simple example and #42 for some more extensive test cases.
-- Fixed #44 in #42. If an output component is returned from a callback and its inputs were _not_ returned from the same input (i.e. they were already visible), then the callback to update the output would not fire. This has now been fixed. A common scenario where this app structure exists is within a Tabbed app, where there are global controls that update each tab's contents and the tab's callback just displays new output containers. See #44 for a simple example and #42 for some more extensive test cases.
-
-## [0.11.2] - 2018-01-08
-### Fixed
-- Removes logging from redux middleware from production build based on process.env.NODE_ENV.
-
-## [0.11.1] - 2017-10-19
-### Fixed
-- :snail: :racehorse: Fixed a performance issue. In 0.11.0 we introduced an  internal request queue to fix some bugs. This request queue was boundless and in certain cases it could become really large and slow down the app. Now, we remove old requests from this queue when they are no longer needed, keeping its size under control. Originally reported in https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/issues/27
-
-## [0.11.0] - 2017-09-28
-### Fixed
-- 🐞 Previously, old requests could override new requests if their response was longer than the new one.
-This caused subtle bugs when apps are deployed on multiple processes or threads with component
-callbacks that update at varying rates like urls. Originally reported in github.com/plotly/dash/issues/133. This fix should also improve performance when many updates happen at once as outdated requests will get dropped instead of updating the UI.
-
-## [0.10.0] - 2017-09-19
-### Fixed
-- Fixed an issue where a callback would be fired on page load and when dynamically generated excessively. Previously, the callback would be called as many times as it had inputs. Now, it is called less. https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/21
-### Maintenance
-- Add percy screenshot tests
-
-
-
-## [0.9.0] - 2017-09-07
-### Fixed
-- 🐞 Fixed a bug where Dash would fire updates for each parent of a grandchild node that shared the same grandparent. Originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/specifying-dependency-tree-traversal/5080/5
-- 🐞 Fixed a bug where the document title that displays "Updating..." wouldn't change if the callback raised an Exception. Now it will be removed on any response, even a failure.
-
-### Added
-- 🐌 Experimental behaviour for a customizable "loading state". When a callback is in motion, Dash now appends a `<div class="_dash-loading-callback"/>` to the DOM.
-Users can style this element using custom CSS to display loading screen overlays.
-This feature is in alpha, we may remove it at any time.
-
-## [0.8.0] - 2017-09-07
-### Added
-- 🔧 Added support for the `requests_pathname_prefix` config parameter introduced in `dash==0.18.0`

-### Removed
-- Remove unofficial support for `/routes`. This was never officially supported and was an antipattern in Dash. URLs and multi-page apps can be specified natively through the `dash_core_components.Link` and `dash_core_components.Location` components. See [https://plot.ly/dash/urls](https://plot.ly/dash/urls) for more details.
-
-## [0.7.3] - 2017-06-20
-### Added
-- Added a class `_dash-undo-redo` to the undo/redo toolbar. This allows the undo/redo to be styled (or even removed)

-### Added
-- [#944](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/944)
-  - relevant `dash.testing` methods can now be called with either an element or a CSS selector: `select_dcc_dropdown`, `multiple_click`, `clear_input`, `zoom_in_graph_by_ratio`, `click_at_coord_fractions`.
-  - Three new `dash.testing` methods: `clear_local_storage`, `clear_session_storage`, and `clear_storage` (to clear both together)
-- [#937](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/937) `dash.testing` adds two APIs `zoom_in_graph_by_ratio` and `click_at_coord_fractions` about advanced interactions using mouse `ActionChain`
-- [#938](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/938) Adds debugging traces to dash backend about serving component suites, so we can use it to verify the installed packages whenever in doubt.

-## [1.0.2] - 2019-07-15
-### Fixed
-- [#821](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/821) Fix a bug with callback error reporting, [#791](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/791).
-
-### Changed

-### Changed
-- 💥 [#808](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/808) Remove strong `dash.testing` dependencies per community feedbacks.
-Testing users should do `pip install dash[testing]` afterwards.
-
-- [#805](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/805) Add headless mode for dash.testing, add `pytest_setup_options` hook for full configuration of `WebDriver Options`.
-
-- Bumped dash-table version from 4.0.0 to [4.0.1](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#401---2019-07-09)
-
-## [1.0.0] - 2019-06-20
-### Changed
-- 💥 [#761](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/761) Several breaking changes to the `dash.Dash` API:
-  - Removed two obsolete constructor kwargs: `static_folder` and `components_cache_max_age`
-  - Removed the misspelled `supress_callback_exceptions` fallback
-  - Removed the unused `resources.config.infer_from_layout`
-  - Revamped `app.config`: ALL constructor args are now stored in `config`, with three exceptions: `server`, `index_string`, and `plugins`. None of these are stored in any other instance attributes anymore.
-  - Changed `hot_reload_interval` from msec to seconds, for consistency with `hot_reload_watch_interval`
-  - When called from `enable_dev_tools`, `debug=True` by default. It's still `False` by default from `run_server`.
-
-- ✨ [#744](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/744) Dash Testing(`dash.testing`) is introduced, read the full tutorial on http://dash.plot.ly/testing.
-
-
-- [#753](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/753) `Component` no longer inherits `MutableMapping`, so `values`, `keys`, and more are no longer methods. This fixed an issue reported in [dcc](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/440) where components with certain prop names defined but not provided would cause a failure to render. During component generation we now disallow all props with leading underscores or matching a few remaining reserved words: `UNDEFINED`, `REQUIRED`, `to_plotly_json`, `available_properties`, and `available_wildcard_properties`.
-
-- [#739](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/739) Allow the Flask app to be provided to Dash after object initialization. This allows users to define Dash layouts etc when using the app factory pattern, or any other pattern that inhibits access to the app object. This broadly complies with the flask extension API, allowing Dash to be considered as a Flask extension where it needs to be.
-
-- [#774](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/774) Allow the Flask app to set the Dash app name if the name is not provided by users.
-
-- [#722](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/722) Assets are served locally by default. Both JS scripts and CSS files are affected. This improves robustness and flexibility in numerous situations, but in certain cases initial loading could be slowed. To restore the previous CDN serving, set `app.scripts.config.serve_locally = False` (and similarly with `app.css`, but this is generally less important).
-
-- Undo/redo toolbar is removed by default, you can enable it with `app=Dash(show_undo_redo=true)`. The CSS hack `._dash-undo-redo:{display:none;}` is no longer needed [#724](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/724)
-
-- 💥[#709](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/709) Merge the `dash-renderer` project into the main dash repo to simplify feature dev workflow. We will keep the [deprecated one](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer) for archive purpose.

-## 0.24.1 - 2018-08-10
-## Fixed
-- Fixed bug in 0.23.1 where importing Dash components with no props would result in an error. (Fixes [#321](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/321)).
-- Fixed bug in 0.23.1 where importing components with arguments that are python keywords could cause an error. In particular, this fixes `dash-html-components` while using Python 3.7.
-
-## 0.24.0 - 2018-08-10
-## Added
-- Add a modified time query string to the assets included in the index in order to bust the cache. [#319](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/309)
-
-
-## 0.23.1 - 2018-08-02
-## Added
-- Add ie-compat meta tag to the index by default. [#316](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/316)
-- Add `external_script` and `external_css` keywords to dash `__init__`. [#305](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/305)
-- Dash components are now generated at build-time and then imported rather than generated when a module is imported. This should reduce the time it takes to import Dash component libraries, and makes Dash compatible with IDEs.
-
-## 0.22.1 - 2018-08-01
-## Fixed
-- Raise a more informative error if a non JSON serializable value is returned from a callback [#273](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/273)
-
-## 0.22.0 - 2018-07-25
-## Added
-- Assets files & index customization [#286](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/286)
-- Raise an error if there is no layout present when the server is running [#294](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/294)
-
-
-## 0.21.1 - 2018-04-10
-## Added
-- `aria-*` and `data-*` attributes are now supported in all dash html components. (#40)
-- These new keywords can be added using a dictionary expansion, e.g. `html.Div(id="my-div", **{"data-toggle": "toggled", "aria-toggled": "true"})`
-
-## 0.21.0 - 2018-02-21
-## Added
-- #207 Dash now supports React components that use [Flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/).
-    To support Flow, `component_loader` now has the following behavior to create docstrings
-    as determined in discussion in [#187](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/187):
-        1. If a Dash component has `PropTypes`-generated typing, the docstring uses the `PropTypes`, _regardless of whether the component also has Flow types (current behavior)._
-        2. Otherwise if a Dash component has Flow types but _not `PropTypes`_, the docstring now uses the objects generated by `react-docgen` from the Flow types.
-
-## 0.20.0 - 2018-01-19
-## Added
-- `exceptions.PreventUpdate` can be raised inside a callback to elegantly prevent
-the callback from updating the app. See https://community.plot.ly/t/improving-handling-of-aborted-callbacks/7536/2 for context
-and #190 for the PR.
-
-## Changed
-- Many pylint style fixes.
-  See #163, #164, #165, #166, #167, #168, #169, #172, #173, #181, #185, #186, #193
-- New integration test framework #184
-- Submodules are now imported into the `dash` namespace for better IDE completion #174
-
-# 0.19.0 - 2017-10-16
-## Changed
-- 🔒  CSRF protection measures were removed as CSRF style attacks are not relevant
-to Dash apps. Dash's API uses `POST` requests with content type
-`application/json` which are not susceptible to unwanted requests from 3rd
-party sites. See https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/141 for more.
-- 🔒  Setting `app.server.secret_key` is no longer required since CSRF protection was
-removed. Setting `app.server.secret_key` was difficult to document and
-a very common source of confusion, so it's great that users won't get bitten
-by this anymore :tada:
-
-# 0.18.3 - 2017-09-08
-## Added
-- `app.config` is now a `dict` instead of a class. You can set config variables with
-  `app.config['suppress_callback_exceptions'] = True` now. The previous class-based
-  syntax (e.g. `app.config.suppress_callback_exceptions`) has been maintained for
-  backwards compatibility
-
-## Fixed
-- 0.18.2 introduced a bug that removed the ability for dash to serve the app on
-  any route besides `/`. This has been fixed.
-- 0.18.0 introduced a bug with the new config variables when used in a multi-app setting.
-  These variables would be shared across apps. This issue has been fixed.
-  Originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/flask-endpoint-error/5691/7
-- The config setting `supress_callback_exceptions` has been renamed to
-  `suppress_callback_exceptions`. Previously, `suppress` was spelled wrong.
-  The original config variable is kept for backwards compatibility.

-# 0.18.3rc1 - 2017-09-08
-The prerelease for 0.18.3
-
-# 0.18.2 - 2017-09-07
-## Added
-- 🔧 Added an `endpoint` to each of the URLs to allow for multiple routes (https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/70)
-
-# 0.18.1 - 2017-09-07
-## Fixed
-- 🐛 If `app.layout` was supplied a function, then it used to be called excessively. Now it is called just once on startup and just once on page load. https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/128
-
-# 0.18.0 - 2017-09-07
-## Changed
-- 🔒  Removes the `/static/` folder and endpoint that is implicitly initialized by flask. This is too implicit for my comfort level: I worry that users will not be aware that their files in their `static` folder are accessible
-- ⚡️  Removes all API calls to the Plotly API (https://api.plot.ly/), the authentication endpoints and decorators, and the associated `filename`, `sharing` and `app_url` arguments. This was never documented or officially supported and authentication has been moved to the [`dash-auth` package](https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth)
-- ✏️ Sorts the prop names in the exception messages (#107)
-
-## Added
-- 🔧 Add two new `config` variables: `routes_pathname_prefix` and `requests_pathname_prefix` to provide more flexibility for API routing when Dash apps are run behind proxy servers. `routes_pathname_prefix` is a prefix applied to the backend routes and `requests_pathname_prefix` prefixed in requests made by Dash's front-end. `dash-renderer==0.8.0rc3` uses these endpoints.
-- 🔧 Added id to KeyError exception in components (#112)
-
-
-## Fixed
-- ✏️  Fix a typo in an exception
-- 🔧 Replaced all illegal characters in environment variable
-
-##🔧 Maintenance
-- 📝  Update README.md
-- ✅  Fix CircleCI tests. Note that the [`dash-renderer`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer) contains the bulk of the integration tests.
-- 💄 Flake8 fixes and tests (fixes #99 )
-- ✨ Added this CHANGELOG.md
-
-# 0.17.3 - 2017-06-22
-✨ This is the initial open-source release of Dash
