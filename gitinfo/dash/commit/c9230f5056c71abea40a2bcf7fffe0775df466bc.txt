 ## Unreleased
 
+### Added
+- [#903](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/903) enables props edited by the user to persist across recreating the component or reloading the page. Components need to define three new props: `persistence`, `persisted_props`, and `persistence_type` as described in the lead comment of `src/persistence.js`. App developers then enable this behavior by, in the simplest case, setting `persistence: true` on the component. First use case is table, see [dash-table#566](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/566)
+
 ### Fixed
 - Reduced about 55% of the dash-renderer packages size on **PyPI** by removing the source maps. To do more advanced debugging, the source maps needs to be generated from source code with `npm run build:local` and pip install in editable mode, i.e. `pip install -e .` [#910](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/910)
