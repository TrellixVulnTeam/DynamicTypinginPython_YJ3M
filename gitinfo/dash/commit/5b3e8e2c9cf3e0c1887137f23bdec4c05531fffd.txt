 #### Development
 
 1. A messy prototype has been written in [@chriddyp/messin](https://github.com/chriddyp/messin) with docs and examples deployed on heroku at http://plotly-dash.herokuapp.com. Also, [dashboards.ly](https://dashboards.ly) (code at [@plotly/dashboards.ly](https://github.com/plotly/dashboards.ly)) contains some drag-and-droppable and editable interaction that dash's edit mode should mimic.
