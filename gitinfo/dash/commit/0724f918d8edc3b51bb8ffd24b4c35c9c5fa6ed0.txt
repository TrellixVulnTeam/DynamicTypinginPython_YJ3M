 ### Changed
 - 💥 [#761](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/761) Several breaking changes to the `dash.Dash` API:
   - Removed two obsolete constructor kwargs: `static_folder` and `components_cache_max_age`

   - When called from `enable_dev_tools`, `debug=True` by default. It's still `False` by default from `run_server`.

 - [#753](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/753) `Component` no longer inherits `MutableMapping`, so `values`, `keys`, and more are no longer methods. This fixed an issue reported in [dcc](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/440) where components with certain prop names defined but not provided would cause a failure to render. During component generation we now disallow all props with leading underscores or matching a few remaining reserved words: `UNDEFINED`, `REQUIRED`, `to_plotly_json`, `available_properties`, and `available_wildcard_properties`.
