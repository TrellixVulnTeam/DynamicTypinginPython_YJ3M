 ## [Unreleased]
 ### Added
-- [#1103](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1103) Wildcard IDs and callbacks. Component IDs can be dictionaries, and callbacks can reference patterns of components, using three different wildcards: `ALL`, `MATCH`, and `ALLSMALLER`, available from `dash.dependencies`. This lets you create components on demand, and have callbacks respond to any and all of them. To help with this, `dash.callback_context` gets three new entries: `outputs_list`, `inputs_list`, and `states_list`, which contain all the ids, properties, and except for the outputs, the property values from all matched components.

 - [#1103](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1103) `dash.testing` option `--pause`: after opening the dash app in a test, will invoke `pdb` for live debugging of both Javascript and Python. Use with a single test case like `pytest -k cbwc001 --pause`.
