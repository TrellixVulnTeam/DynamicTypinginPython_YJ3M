+# Change Log for dash-core-components
+All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
+This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
+
+## v0.7.4 - 07/20/2017
+### Removed
+- Remove unofficial support for `/routes`. This was never officially supported and was an antipattern in Dash. URLs and multi-page apps can be specified natively through the `dash_core_components.Link` and `dash_core_components.Location` components. See [https://plot.ly/dash/urls](https://plot.ly/dash/urls) for more details.
+
+## 0.7.3 - 06/20/2017
+### Added
+- Added a class `_dash-undo-redo` to the undo/redo toolbar. This allows the undo/redo to be styled (or even removed)
