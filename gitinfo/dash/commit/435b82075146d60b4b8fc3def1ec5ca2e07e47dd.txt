 # Dash
 
-## Analytical Web Apps for Python
+## Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.
+
+Build on top of Plotly.js, React, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical python code.

-Dash is a Python library for creating analytical web-based applications.
- Here’s a 43-line example of a Dash App that ties a Dropdown to a D3.js Plotly Graph.
- As the user selects a value in the Dropdown, the application code dynamically
- exports data from Google Finance into a Pandas DataFrame. This app was written in just 43 lines of code ([view the source](https://gist.github.com/chriddyp/3d2454905d8f01886d651f207e2419f0)).

 Dash app code is declarative and reactive, which makes it easy to build complex apps that contain many interactive elements. Here’s an example with 5 inputs, 3 outputs, and cross filtering. This app was composed in just 160 lines of code, all of which were Python.

+Dash uses [Plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) for charting. Over 35 chart types are supported, including maps.

+Dash isn't just for dashboards. You have full control over the look and feel of your applications. Here's a Dash app that's styled to look like a PDF report.
