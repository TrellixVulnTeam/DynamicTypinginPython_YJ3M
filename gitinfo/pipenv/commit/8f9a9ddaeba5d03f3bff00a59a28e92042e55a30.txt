 Pipenv: Sacred Marriage of Pipfile, Pip, & Virtualenv 
 =====================================================
 
-Pipenv is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain.
+Pipenv is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors. 
 
 It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your ``Pipfile`` as you install/uninstall packages. The ``lock`` command generates a lockfile (``Pipfile.lock``).
