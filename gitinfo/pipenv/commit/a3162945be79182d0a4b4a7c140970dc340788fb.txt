+You can install packages with pipenv from git and other version control systems using URLs formatted according to the following rule:
+
+```
+    <vcs_type>+<scheme>://<location>/<user_or_organizatoin>/<repository>@<branch_or_tag>#<package_name>
+```
+
+The only optional section is the `@<branch_or_tag>` section.  When using git over SSH, you may use the shorthand vcs and scheme alias `git+git@<location>:<user_or_organization>/<repository>@<branch_or_tag>#<package_name>`. Note that this is translated to `git+ssh://git@<location>` when parsed.
 
-You can also change the tag/ref (or exclude to get the latest version) by adding @version-or-tag before #egg=project_name
+Valid values for `<vcs_type>` include `git`, `bzr`, `svn`, and `hg`.  Valid values for `<scheme>` include `http,`, `https`, `ssh`, and `file`.  In specific cases you also have access to other schemes: `svn` may be combined with `svn` as a scheme, and `bzr` can be combined with `sftp` and `lp`.
+
+Note that it is **strongly recommended** that you install any version-controlled dependencies in editable mode in order to ensure that dependency resolution can be performed with an up to date copy of the repository each time it is performed, and that it includes all known dependencies.
+
+Below is an example usage which installs the git repository located at `https://github.com/requests/requests.git` from tag `v2.19.1` as package name `requests`:
+
+```console
+    $ pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@v2.19#egg=requests
+    Creating a Pipfile for this project...
