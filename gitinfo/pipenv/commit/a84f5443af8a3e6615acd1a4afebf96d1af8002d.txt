    Incorrect ref in VCS example
    
    Small changes, but a couple of issues in the `A Note About VCS Dependencies` section of the docs.
    
    Running the example `$ pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@v2.19#egg=requests` raises the error: `Did not find branch or tag 'v2.19', assuming revision or ref.` I think it should be 'v2.19.1' which is just a typo as 'v2.19.1' is used in the subsequent lines of the example.
    
    The example Pipfile in the  section excludes the `v` in the version number written to the `ref = ` part. I found it a little confusing that it would strip the 'v' from the tag, but then on testing it I found that it doesn't do that:
    
    ```
    [packages]
    requests = {editable = true, ref = "v2.20.1", git = "https://github.com/requests/requests.git"}
    ```
    
    Also, while I was here I figured I'd update the example to the most recent requests release.
    
    Thanks.

 Note that it is **strongly recommended** that you install any version-controlled dependencies in editable mode, using ``pipenv install -e``, in order to ensure that dependency resolution can be performed with an up to date copy of the repository each time it is performed, and that it includes all known dependencies.

 Valid values for ``<vcs_type>`` include ``git``, ``bzr``, ``svn``, and ``hg``.  Valid values for ``<scheme>`` include ``http``, ``https``, ``ssh``, and ``file``.  In specific cases you also have access to other schemes: ``svn`` may be combined with ``svn`` as a scheme, and ``bzr`` can be combined with ``sftp`` and ``lp``.
