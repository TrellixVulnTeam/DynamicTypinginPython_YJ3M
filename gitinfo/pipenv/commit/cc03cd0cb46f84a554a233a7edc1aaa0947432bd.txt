 Features & Improvements
 -----------------------
 
-- Improved exceptions and error handling on failures.`#1977 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1977>`_
-- Added persistent settings for all CLI flags via ``PIPENV_{FLAG_NAME}`` environment variables by enabling ``auto_envvar_prefix=PIPENV`` in click (implements PEEP-0002).`#2200 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2200>`_
-- Added improved messaging about available but skipped updates due to dependency conflicts when running ``pipenv update --outdated``.`#2411 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2411>`_
