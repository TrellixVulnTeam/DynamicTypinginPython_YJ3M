    remove escape character from pexpect.spawn.interact
    
    The default escape character for pexpect.spaw is ctrl-]
    which conflicts with a vim binding. This isn't an escape
    sequence that is mirrored in virtualenv, so there doesn't
    seem to be a good reason to keep it. This will make `pipenv
    shell` more inline with the standard `virtualenv workon` command.
