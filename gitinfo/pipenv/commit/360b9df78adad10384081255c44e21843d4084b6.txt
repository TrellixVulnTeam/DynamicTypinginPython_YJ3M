+# PEEP-000: Pipenv Governance Model
+
+Pipenv will be governed by a BDFL (Kenneth Reitz), and a board of maintainers (trusted collaborators to the project on GitHub).
+
+â˜¤
+
+## BDFL Responsibility & PEEP Acceptance
+
+The approval of future PEEPs is the responsiblity of the BDFL, unless they defer the decision--making to the trusted board of mainters, for a given PEEP.
+
+## Trusted Maintainer Responsibility
+
+-   Maintain Pipenv's already--established interface --- prevent it from eroding.
+-   Polish what already exists. Do not craft.
+-   Enforce the PEEP process.
+
+## Community Responsibility
+
+-   Reduce the burden on the maintainers by not requesting new features or changes in functionality, unless by the PEEP process.
+-   Avoid writing PEEPs, unless it seems absolutely neccessary, and in the best interest of the entire Python community.
+-   Remember, all deltas are risks.
