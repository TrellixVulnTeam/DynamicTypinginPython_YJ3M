+# PEEP-003: Revocation of Power of BDFL
+
+**ACCEPTED**
+
+Pipenv will be governed by a board of maintainers (trusted collaborators to the project on GitHub), not a BDFL.
+
+The BDFL retains his title, however, revokes himself of his powers.
+
+PEEP approval will be determined by available members of the board of maintainers, in private or public channels.
