    Correct csh syntax in activate_virtualenv
    
    In csh, the . operator executes a directory, which is the wrong
    behaviour here. At best, when pipenv is installed system-wide
    (preferably via the operating system package manager), the result
    is a permission denied error from the shell.
    
    As csh uses the source command, reflect that here.
