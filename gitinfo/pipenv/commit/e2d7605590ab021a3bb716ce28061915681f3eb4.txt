 ``Pipfile.lock`` takes advantage of some great new security improvements in ``pip``.
-By default, the ``Pipfile.lock`` will be generated with a sha256 hash of the downloaded
-package. This will allow pip to guarantee you're installing what you intend to when on a
-compromised network, or downloading dependencies from an untrusted PyPI endpoint.
-
-We highly recommend approaching deployments with a development->production approach. You
-can use ``pipenv lock`` to compile your dependencies on your development environment and
-deploy the compiled Pipfile.lock to all of your production environments for reproducible
-builds.

 .. note:: Due to different hashes being generated between wheels on different systems, you
           will find hashes don't work cross-platform or between Python versions.
