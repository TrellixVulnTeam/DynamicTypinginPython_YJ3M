 These packages are copied as-is from upstream to reduce Pipenv dependencies.
 They should always be kept synced with upstream. DO NOT MODIFY DIRECTLY! If
-you need to patch anything, move the package to `patched`.
+you need to patch anything, move the package to `patched` and generate a
+patch for it using `git diff -p <dependency_root_dir>`. This patch belongs
+in `./pipenv/tasks/vendoring/patches/patched/<packagename.patchdesc>.patch`.
 
-Known vendored versions:
+To add a vendored dependency or to update a single dependency, use the
+vendoring scripts:
+```
+    pipenv run inv vendoring.update --package="pkgname==versionnum"
+```
 
-- python-dotenv: 0.8.2
+This will automatically pin the package in `./pipenv/vendor/vendor.txt`
+or it will update the pin if the package is already present, and it will
+then update the package and download any necessary licenses (if available).
+Note that this will not download any dependencies, you must add those each
+individually.
 
-When updating, update the corresponding LICENSE files as well.
+When updating, ensure that the corresponding LICENSE files are still 
+up-to-date.
