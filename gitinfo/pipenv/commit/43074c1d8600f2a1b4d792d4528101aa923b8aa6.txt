    Exclude more things from installation which aren't meant to be installed
    
    find_packages' exclude keyword is a bit unintuitive in that it only
    excludes the top-level directory specified, but happily includes all the
    children unless you wildcard those too.
    
    Update this to actually match the original intent.
