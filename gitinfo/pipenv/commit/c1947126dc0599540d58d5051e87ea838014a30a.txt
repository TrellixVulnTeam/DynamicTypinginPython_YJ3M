    Revise `pipenv check` caveat for pyup.io feedback
    
    Jannis Gebauer of pyup.io let us know that he's definitely fine
    with commercial *use* of the `pipenv check` feature, so it's
    only commercial redistributors of `pipenv` that may need to
    take a closer look at the licensing situation, and perhaps
    talk to `pyup.io` directly.
    
    Follow-up to #1651
