+2018.05.18 (2018-06-17)
+=======================
+
+
+Features & Improvements
+-----------------------
+
+- Pipenv-created virtualenvs will now be associated with a ``.project`` folder
+  (features can be implemented on top of this later or users may choose to use
+  ``pipenv-pipes`` to take full advantage of this.)  `#1861
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1861>`_
+
+- Virtualenv names will now appear in prompts for most Windows users.  `#2167
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2167>`_
+
+- Added support for cmder shell paths with spaces.  `#2168
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2168>`_
+
+- Added nested JSON output to the ``pipenv graph`` command.  `#2199
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2199>`_
+
+- Dropped vendored pip 9 and vendor, patch, and migrate to pip 10. Updated
+  patched piptools version.  `#2255
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2255>`_
+
+- PyPI mirror URLs can now be set to override instances of PyPI urls by passing
+  the ``--pypi-mirror`` argument from the command line or setting the
+  ``PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`` environment variable.  `#2281
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2281>`_
+
+- Virtualenv activation lines will now avoid being written to some shell
+  history files.  `#2287 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2287>`_
+
+- Pipenv will now only search for ``requirements.txt`` files when creating new
+  projects, and during that time only if the user doesn't specify packages to
+  pass in.  `#2309 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2309>`_
+
+- Added support for mounted drives via UNC paths.  `#2331
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2331>`_
+
+- Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux bash shell detection.  `#2363
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2363>`_
+
+
+Behavior Changes
+----------------
+
+- Pipenv will now parse & capitalize ``platform_python_implementation`` markers
+  -- **note** this could cause an issue if you have an out of date ``Pipfile``
+  which lowercases the comparison value (e.g. ``cpython`` instead of
+  ``CPython``).  `#2123 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2123>`_
+
+
+Bug Fixes
+---------
+
+- Massive internal improvements to requirements parsing codebase, resolver, and
+  error messaging.  `#1962 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1962>`_,
+  `#2186 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2186>`_,
+  `#2263 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2263>`_,
+  `#2312 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2312>`_
+
+- Pipenv will now parse & capitalize ``platform_python_implementation`` markers
+  -- **note** this could cause an issue if you have an out of date ``Pipfile``
+  which lowercases the comparison value (e.g. ``cpython`` instead of
+  ``CPython``).  `#2123 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2123>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug with parsing and grouping old-style setup.py extras during
+  resolution  `#2142 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2142>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug causing pipenv graph to throw unhelpful exceptions when running
+  against empty or non-existent environments.  `#2161
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2161>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug which caused ``--system`` to incorrectly abort when users were in
+  a virtualenv.  `#2181 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2181>`_
+
+- Removed vendored ``cacert.pem`` which could cause issues for some users with
+  custom certificate settings.  `#2193
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2193>`_
+
+- Fixed a regression which led to direct invocations of ``virtualenv``, rather
+  than calling it by module.  `#2198
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2198>`_
+
+- Locking will now pin the correct VCS ref during ``pipenv update`` runs.
+  Running ``pipenv update`` with a new vcs ref specified in the ``Pipfile``
+  will now properly obtain, resolve, and install the specified dependency at
+  the specified ref.  `#2209 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2209>`_
+
+- ``pipenv clean`` will now correctly ignore comments from ``pip freeze`` when
+  cleaning the environment.  `#2262
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2262>`_
+
+- Resolution bugs causing packages for incompatible python versions to be
+  locked have been fixed.  `#2267
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2267>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug causing pipenv graph to fail to display sometimes.  `#2268
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2268>`_
+
+- Updated requirementslib to fix a bug in pipfile parsing affecting relative
+  path conversions.  `#2269 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2269>`_
+
+- Windows executable discovery now leverages ``os.pathext``.  `#2298
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2298>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug which caused ``--deploy --system`` to inadvertently create a
+  virtualenv before failing.  `#2301
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2301>`_
+
+- Fixed an issue which led to a failure to unquote special characters in file
+  and wheel paths.  `#2302 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2302>`_
+
+- VCS dependencies are now manually obtained only if they do not match the
+  requested ref.  `#2304 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2304>`_
+
+
+Vendored Libraries
+------------------
+
+- Removed vendored ``cacert.pem`` which could cause issues for some users with
+  custom certificate settings.  `#2193
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2193>`_
+
+- Dropped vendored pip 9 and vendor, patch, and migrate to pip 10. Updated
+  patched piptools version.  `#2255
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2255>`_
+
+- Updated requirementslib to fix a bug in pipfile parsing affecting relative
+  path conversions.  `#2269 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2269>`_
+
+- Added custom shell detection library ``shellingham``, a port of our changes
+  to ``pew``.  `#2363 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2363>`_
+
+Updated vendored libraries. The following vendored libraries were updated: 
+  * distlib from version ``0.2.6`` to ``0.2.7``.
+  * jinja2 from version ``2.9.5`` to ``2.10``.
+  * pathlib2 from version ``2.1.0`` to ``2.3.2``.
+  * parse from version ``2.8.0`` to ``2.8.4``.
+  * pexpect from version ``2.5.2`` to ``2.6.0``.
+  * requests from version ``2.18.4`` to ``2.19.1``.
+  * idna from version ``2.6`` to ``2.7``.
+  * certifi from version ``2018.1.16`` to ``2018.4.16``.
+  * packaging from version ``16.8`` to ``17.1``.
+  * six from version ``1.10.0`` to ``1.11.0``.
+  * requirementslib from version ``0.2.0`` to ``1.0.1``. 
+
+In addition, scandir was vendored and patched to avoid importing host system binaries when falling back to pathlib2.  `#2368  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2368>`_
