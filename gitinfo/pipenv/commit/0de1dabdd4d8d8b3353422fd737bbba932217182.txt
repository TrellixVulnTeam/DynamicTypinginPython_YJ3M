     - ``PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS`` — Set to disable automatically using an activated virtualenv over
       the current project's own virtual environment.

 If you'd like to set these environment variables on a per-project basis, I recommend utilizing the fantastic `direnv <https://direnv.net>`_ project, in order to do so.
 
 Also note that `pip itself supports environment variables <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#environment-variables>`_, if you need additional customization.
