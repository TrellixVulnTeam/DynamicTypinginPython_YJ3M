-**Pipenv** is a project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world in a single tool — harnessesing `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_, and `virtualenv <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`_ together in unison. It also features very pretty terminal colors.
