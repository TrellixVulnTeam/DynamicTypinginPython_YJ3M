 - Virtual environment activation for ``run`` is revised to improve interpolation
   with other Python discovery tools.  `#2503 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2503>`_
-

 - Improve terminal coloring to display better in Powershell.  `#2511 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2511>`_

 - Invoke ``virtualenv`` directly for virtual environment creation, instead of depending on ``pew``.  `#2518 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2518>`_
-  
+
 - ``pipenv --help`` will now include short help descriptions.  `#2542 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2542>`_

   if shell detection fails, improving robustness on Windows.  `#2651 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2651>`_
-  
+
 - Fallback to shell mode if `run` fails with Windows error 193 to handle non-executable commands. This should improve usability on Windows, where some users run non-executable files without specifying a command, relying on Windows file association to choose the current command.  `#2718 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2718>`_
