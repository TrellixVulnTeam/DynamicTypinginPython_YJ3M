+Thank you for contributing to Pipenv!
+
+
+##### The issue
+
+What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.
+
+Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.
+
+
+##### The fix
+
+How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?
+
+
+##### The checklist
+
+* [ ] Associated issue
+* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix (this will appear in the release changelog).
+
+
+##### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory…
+
+Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.
+
+A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and perform vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.
+
+If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.
