    Update deployment section of advanced docs
    
    Clarify that `--deploy` is meant for enforcement and intentionally
    failing a build.
    Mention `pipenv sync` in the same section to try to establish it more
    clearly as the most obvious and normal way of doing installation from
    ``Pipfile.lock`` as part of a reproducible build process.
    
    Explicitly recommend against `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile` and
    suggest that it may be deprecated.

+☤ Using pipenv for Deployments

-☤ Deploying System Dependencies
--------------------------------
+You may want to use ``pipenv`` as part of a deployment process.
 
-You can tell Pipenv to install a Pipfile's contents into its parent system with the ``--system`` flag::
+You can enforce that your ``Pipfile.lock`` is up to date using the ``--deploy`` flag::
 
-    $ pipenv install --system
+    $ pipenv install --deploy
 
-This is useful for Docker containers, and deployment infrastructure (e.g. Heroku does this).
+This will fail a build if the ``Pipfile.lock`` is out–of–date, instead of generating a new one.
 
-Also useful for deployment is the ``--deploy`` flag::
+Or you can install packages exactly as specified in ``Pipfile.lock`` using the sync command::
 
-    $ pipenv install --system --deploy
+    $ pipenv sync
 
-This will fail a build if the ``Pipfile.lock`` is out–of–date, instead of generating a new one.
+Note: ``pipenv install --ignore-pipfile`` is nearly equivalent to ``pipenv sync``, but you should use ``pipenv sync`` instead.
+``--ignore-pipfile`` may be removed in a future version.
