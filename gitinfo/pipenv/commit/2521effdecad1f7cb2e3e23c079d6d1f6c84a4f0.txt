    Update diagnose URL
    
    Related to https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3958
    
    Going to the old URL https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/diagnose/ was giving an SSL error.
    
    This can be fixed in two ways
    1. Update URL to http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/diagnose/
    1. Update URL to https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/diagnose/
    
    I chose the second approach to match the project homepage URL.
