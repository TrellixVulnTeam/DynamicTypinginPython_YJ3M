-☤ Automatic Python Installation
--------------------------------
-
-If you have `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#simple-python-version-management-pyenv>`_ installed and configured, Pipenv will automatically ask you if you want to install a required version of Python if you don't already have it available.
-
-This is a very fancy feature, and we're very proud of it::

-Pipenv automatically honors both the ``python_full_version`` and ``python_version`` `PEP 508 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/>`_ specifiers.
