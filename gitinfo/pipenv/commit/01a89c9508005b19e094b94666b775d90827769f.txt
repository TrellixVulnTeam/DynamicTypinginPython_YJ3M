-Frequently Encountered Pipenv Problems
-======================================
-
-Pipenv is constantly being improved by volunteers, but is still a very young
-project with limited resources, and has some quirks that needs to be dealt
-with. We need everyone’s help (including yours!).
-
-Here are some common questions people have using Pipenv. Please take a look
-below and see if they resolve your problem.
-
-.. Note:: **Make sure you’re running the newest Pipenv version first!**
-
-☤ Your dependencies could not be resolved
------------------------------------------
-
-Make sure your dependencies actually *do* resolve. If you’re confident they
-are, you may need to clear your resolver cache. Run the following command::
-
-    pipenv-resolver --clear
-
-And try again.
-
-Pipenv does not install prereleases (i.e. a version with an alpha/beta/etc.
-suffix, such as *1.0b1*) by default. You will need to pass the ``--pre`` flag
-in your command, or set
-
-::
-
-    [pipenv]
-    allow_prereleases = true
-
-in your Pipfile.
-
-☤ No module named <module name>
----------------------------------
-
-This is usually a result of mixing Pipenv with system packages. We *strongly*
-recommend installing Pipenv in an isolated environment. Uninstall all existing
-Pipenv installations, and see :ref:`proper_installation` to choose one of the
-recommended way to install Pipenv instead.
-
-☤ My pyenv-installed Python is not found
-----------------------------------------
-
-Make sure you have ``PYENV_ROOT`` set correctly. Pipenv only supports CPython
-distributions.
-
-☤ ``shell`` does not show the virtualenv’s name in prompt
----------------------------------------------------------
-
-This is intentional. You can do it yourself with either shell plugins, or
-clever ``PS1`` configuration. If you really want it back, use
-
-::
-
-    pipenv shell -c
-
-instead (not available on Windows).
-
-☤ Pipenv does not respect dependencies in setup.py
---------------------------------------------------
-
-No, it does not, intentionally. Pipfile and setup.py serve different purposes,
-and should not consider each other by default. See :ref:`pipfile-vs-setuppy`
-for more information.
