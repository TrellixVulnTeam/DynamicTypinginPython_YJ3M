    Mention --keep-outdated in docs for importing
    
    When importing from requirements.txt, it may be useful to
    keep the versions of packages you have for the moment,
    while unpinning them for the future.  This is already supported
    via `--keep-outdated`; this commit adds a mention to the docs.
    Fixes #908.
