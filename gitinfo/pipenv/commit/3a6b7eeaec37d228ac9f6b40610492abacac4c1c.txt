+2018.6.25 (2018-06-25)
+======================
+
+Features & Improvements
+-----------------------
+
+- Pipenv-created virtualenvs will now be associated with a ``.project`` folder
+  (features can be implemented on top of this later or users may choose to use
+  ``pipenv-pipes`` to take full advantage of this.)  `#1861
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1861>`_
+
+- Virtualenv names will now appear in prompts for most Windows users.  `#2167
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2167>`_
+
+- Added support for cmder shell paths with spaces.  `#2168
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2168>`_
+
+- Added nested JSON output to the ``pipenv graph`` command.  `#2199
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2199>`_
+
+- Dropped vendored pip 9 and vendored, patched, and migrated to pip 10. Updated
+  patched piptools version.  `#2255
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2255>`_
+
+- PyPI mirror URLs can now be set to override instances of PyPI urls by passing
+  the ``--pypi-mirror`` argument from the command line or setting the
+  ``PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`` environment variable.  `#2281
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2281>`_
+
+- Virtualenv activation lines will now avoid being written to some shell
+  history files.  `#2287 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2287>`_
+
+- Pipenv will now only search for ``requirements.txt`` files when creating new
+  projects, and during that time only if the user doesn't specify packages to
+  pass in.  `#2309 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2309>`_
+
+- Added support for mounted drives via UNC paths.  `#2331
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2331>`_
+
+- Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux bash shell detection.  `#2363
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2363>`_
+
+- Pipenv will now generate hashes much more quickly by resolving them in a
+  single pass during locking.  `#2384
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2384>`_
+
+- ``pipenv run`` will now avoid spawning additional ``COMSPEC`` instances to
+  run commands in when possible.  `#2385
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2385>`_
+
+- Massive internal improvements to requirements parsing codebase, resolver, and
+  error messaging.  `#2388 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2388>`_
+
+- ``pipenv check`` now may take multiple of the additional argument
+  ``--ignore`` which takes a parameter ``cve_id`` for the purpose of ignoring
+  specific CVEs.  `#2408 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2408>`_
+
+
+Behavior Changes
+----------------
+
+- Pipenv will now parse & capitalize ``platform_python_implementation`` markers
+  .. warning:: This could cause an issue if you have an out of date ``Pipfile``
+  which lowercases the comparison value (e.g. ``cpython`` instead of
+  ``CPython``).  `#2123 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2123>`_
+
+- Pipenv will now only search for ``requirements.txt`` files when creating new
+  projects, and during that time only if the user doesn't specify packages to
+  pass in.  `#2309 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2309>`_
+
+
+Bug Fixes
+---------
+
+- Massive internal improvements to requirements parsing codebase, resolver, and
+  error messaging.  `#1962 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1962>`_,
+  `#2186 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2186>`_,
+  `#2263 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2263>`_,
+  `#2312 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2312>`_
+
+- Pipenv will now parse & capitalize ``platform_python_implementation``
+  markers.  `#2123 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2123>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug with parsing and grouping old-style ``setup.py`` extras during
+  resolution  `#2142 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2142>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug causing pipenv graph to throw unhelpful exceptions when running
+  against empty or non-existent environments.  `#2161
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2161>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug which caused ``--system`` to incorrectly abort when users were in
+  a virtualenv.  `#2181 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2181>`_
+
+- Removed vendored ``cacert.pem`` which could cause issues for some users with
+  custom certificate settings.  `#2193
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2193>`_
+
+- Fixed a regression which led to direct invocations of ``virtualenv``, rather
+  than calling it by module.  `#2198
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2198>`_
+
+- Locking will now pin the correct VCS ref during ``pipenv update`` runs.
+  Running ``pipenv update`` with a new vcs ref specified in the ``Pipfile``
+  will now properly obtain, resolve, and install the specified dependency at
+  the specified ref.  `#2209 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2209>`_
+
+- ``pipenv clean`` will now correctly ignore comments from ``pip freeze`` when
+  cleaning the environment.  `#2262
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2262>`_
+
+- Resolution bugs causing packages for incompatible python versions to be
+  locked have been fixed.  `#2267
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2267>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug causing pipenv graph to fail to display sometimes.  `#2268
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2268>`_
+
+- Updated ``requirementslib`` to fix a bug in pipfile parsing affecting
+  relative path conversions.  `#2269
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2269>`_
+
+- Windows executable discovery now leverages ``os.pathext``.  `#2298
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2298>`_
+
+- Fixed a bug which caused ``--deploy --system`` to inadvertently create a
+  virtualenv before failing.  `#2301
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2301>`_
+
+- Fixed an issue which led to a failure to unquote special characters in file
+  and wheel paths.  `#2302 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2302>`_
+
+- VCS dependencies are now manually obtained only if they do not match the
+  requested ref.  `#2304 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2304>`_
+
+- Added error handling functionality to properly cope with single-digit
+  ``Requires-Python`` metatdata with no specifiers.  `#2377
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2377>`_
+
+- ``pipenv update`` will now always run the resolver and lock before ensuring
+  your dependencies are in sync with your lockfile.  `#2379
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2379>`_
+
+- Resolved a bug in our patched resolvers which could cause nondeterministic
+  resolution failures in certain conditions. Running ``pipenv install`` with no
+  arguments in a project with only a ``Pipfile`` will now correctly lock first
+  for dependency resolution before installing.  `#2384
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2384>`_
+
+- Patched ``python-dotenv`` to ensure that environment variables always get
+  encoded to the filesystem encoding.  `#2386
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2386>`_
+
+
+Vendored Libraries
+------------------
+
+- Removed vendored ``cacert.pem`` which could cause issues for some users with
+  custom certificate settings.  `#2193
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2193>`_
+
+- Dropped vendored pip 9 and vendored, patched, and migrated to pip 10. Updated
+  patched piptools version.  `#2255
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2255>`_
+
+- Updated ``requirementslib`` to fix a bug in pipfile parsing affecting
+  relative path conversions.  `#2269
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2269>`_
+
+- Added custom shell detection library ``shellingham``, a port of our changes
+  to ``pew``.  `#2363 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2363>`_
+
+- Updated vendored libraries. The following vendored libraries were updated: *
+  distlib from version ``0.2.6`` to ``0.2.7``. * jinja2 from version ``2.9.5``
+  to ``2.10``. * pathlib2 from version ``2.1.0`` to ``2.3.2``. * parse from
+  version ``2.8.0`` to ``2.8.4``. * pexpect from version ``2.5.2`` to
+  ``2.6.0``. * requests from version ``2.18.4`` to ``2.19.1``. * idna from
+  version ``2.6`` to ``2.7``. * certifi from version ``2018.1.16`` to
+  ``2018.4.16``. * packaging from version ``16.8`` to ``17.1``. * six from
+  version ``1.10.0`` to ``1.11.0``. * requirementslib from version ``0.2.0`` to
+  ``1.0.1``. In addition, scandir was vendored and patched to avoid importing
+  host system binaries when falling back to pathlib2.  `#2368
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2368>`_
+
+- Patched ``python-dotenv`` to ensure that environment variables always get
+  encoded to the filesystem encoding.  `#2386
+  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2386>`_
+
