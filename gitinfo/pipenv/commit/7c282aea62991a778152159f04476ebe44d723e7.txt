commit 7c282aea62991a778152159f04476ebe44d723e7
Author: Paul Crowley <paulcrowley@google.com>

    Replace docs.pipenv.org with pipenv.pypa.io
    
    `dig pipenv.org ns` currently shows no nameserver for that domain;
    pipenv.pypa.io is the new home for documentation, so use that
    everywhere (contributors guides, `pipenv --envs` output).
