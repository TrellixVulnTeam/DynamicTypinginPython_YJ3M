    Fix `pipenv install --dev` description
    
    By default, `pipenv install` will install packages
    based on the list in `Pipfile`, not `Pipfile.lock`.
    `pipenv install --dev` is no exception.
    
    I've tested this using pipenv 2018.7.1
    with different package versions in `Pipfile`
    and `Pipfile.lock`. After `pipenv install`,
    the versions in `Pipfile` were the ones
    actually installed.
