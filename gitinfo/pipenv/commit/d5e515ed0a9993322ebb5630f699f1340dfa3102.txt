 - Automatically generates a ``Pipfile``, if one doesn't exist.
-- Automatically generates a ``Pipfile.lock``, if one doesn't exist.
 - Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location.

+- Automatically adds/removes packages to a ``Pipfile`` when they are un/installed.
 - Automatically loads ``.env`` files, if they exist.
 
 The main commands are ``install``, ``uninstall``, and ``lock``, which generates a ``Pipfile.lock``. These are intended to replace ``$ pip install`` usage, as well as manual virtualenv management (to activate a virtualenv, run ``$ pipenv shell``).
