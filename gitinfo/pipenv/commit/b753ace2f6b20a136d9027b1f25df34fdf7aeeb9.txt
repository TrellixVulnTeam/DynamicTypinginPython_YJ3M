+
+Frequently Encountered Pipenv Problems
+======================================
+
+Pipenv is constantly being improved by volunteers, but we have limited
+resources, and Pipenv is still a very young project, and has some quirks that
+needs to be dealt with. We need everyone’s help (including yours!).
+
+Here are some common questions people have using Pipenv. Please take a look
+below and see if they resolve your problem.
+
+.. Note:: **Make sure you’re running the newest Pipenv version first!**
+
+☤ Your dependencies could not be resolved
+-----------------------------------------
+
+Make sure your dependencies actually *do* resolve. If you’re confident they
+are, you may need to clear your resolver cache. Run the following command::
+
+    pipenv-resolver --clear
+
+And try again.
+
+Pipenv does not install prereleases (i.e. a version with an alpha/beta/etc.
+suffix, such as *1.0b1*) by default. You will need to pass the ``--pre`` flag
+in your command, or set
+
+::
+
+    [pipenv]
+    allow_prereleases = true
+
+in your Pipfile.
+
+☤ No module named <module name>
+---------------------------------
+
+This is usually a result of mixing Pipenv with system packages. We *strongly*
+recommend installing Pipenv in an isolated environment. Uninstall all existing
+Pipenv installations, and see :ref:`proper_installation` to choose one of the
+recommended way to install Pipenv instead.
+
+☤ My pyenv-installed Python is not found
+----------------------------------------
+
+Make sure you have ``PYENV_ROOT`` set correctly. Pipenv only supports CPython
+distributions.
+
+☤ ``shell`` does not show the virtualenv’s name in prompt
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+This is intentional. You can do it yourself with either shell plugins, or
+clever ``PS1`` configuration. If you really want it back, use
+
+::
+
+    pipenv shell -c
+
+instead (not available on Windows).
+
+☤ Pipenv does not respect dependencies in setup.py
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+No, it does not, intentionally. Pipfile and setup.py serve different purposes,
+and should not consider each other by default. See :ref:`pipfile-vs-setuppy`
+for more information.
