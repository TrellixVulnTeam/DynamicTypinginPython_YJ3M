+2018.10.9 (2018-10-09)
+======================
+
+Features & Improvements
+-----------------------
+
+- Added environment variables `PIPENV_VERBOSE` and `PIPENV_QUIET` to control
+  output verbosity without needing to pass options.  `#2527 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2527>`_
+  
+- Updated test-pypi addon to better support json-api access (forward compatibility).
+  Improved testing process for new contributors.  `#2568 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2568>`_
+  
+- Greatly enhanced python discovery functionality:
+
+  - Added pep514 (windows launcher/finder) support for python discovery.
+  - Introduced architecture discovery for python installations which support different architectures.  `#2582 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2582>`_
+  
+- Added support for ``pipenv shell`` on msys and cygwin/mingw/git bash for windwos.  `#2641 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2641>`_
+  
+- Enhanced resolution of editable and VCS dependencies.  `#2643 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2643>`_
+  
+- Deduplicate and refactor CLI to use stateful arguments and object passing.  See `this issue <https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/108>`_ for reference.  `#2814 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2814>`_
+  
+
+Behavior Changes
+----------------
+
+- Virtual environment activation for ``run`` is revised to improve interpolation
+  with other Python discovery tools.  `#2503 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2503>`_
+  
+- Improve terminal coloring to display better in Powershell.  `#2511 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2511>`_
+  
+- Invoke ``virtualenv`` directly for virtual environment creation, instead of depending on ``pew``.  `#2518 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2518>`_
+  
+- ``pipenv --help`` will now include short help descriptions.  `#2542 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2542>`_
+  
+- Add ``COMSPEC`` to fallback option (along with ``SHELL`` and ``PYENV_SHELL``)
+  if shell detection fails, improving robustness on Windows.  `#2651 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2651>`_
+  
+- Fallback to shell mode if `run` fails with Windows error 193 to handle non-executable commands. This should improve usability on Windows, where some users run non-executable files without specifying a command, relying on Windows file association to choose the current command.  `#2718 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2718>`_
+  
+
+Bug Fixes
+---------
+
+- Fixed a bug which prevented installation of editable requirements using ``ssh://`` style urls  `#1393 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1393>`_
+  
+- VCS Refs for locked local editable dependencies will now update appropriately to the latest hash when running ``pipenv update``.  `#1690 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1690>`_
+  
+- ``.tar.gz`` and ``.zip`` artifacts will now have dependencies installed even when they are missing from the lockfile.  `#2173 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2173>`_
+  
+- The command line parser will now handle multiple ``-e/--editable`` dependencies properly via click's option parser to help mitigate future parsing issues.  `#2279 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2279>`_
+  
+- Fixed the ability of pipenv to parse ``dependency_links`` from ``setup.py`` when ``PIP_PROCESS_DEPENDENCY_LINKS`` is enabled.  `#2434 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2434>`_
+  
+- Fixed a bug which could cause ``-i/--index`` arguments to sometimes be incorrectly picked up in packages.  This is now handled in the command line parser.  `#2494 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2494>`_
+  
+- Fixed non-deterministic resolution issues related to changes to the internal package finder in ``pip 10``.  `#2499 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2499>`_,

+  
+- Fix subshell invocation on Windows for Python 2.  `#2515 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2515>`_
+

+  
+- Fixed an issue which prevented passing multiple ``--ignore`` parameters to ``pipenv check``.  `#2632 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2632>`_
+  
+- Fixed a bug which caused attempted hashing of ``ssh://`` style URIs which could cause failures during installation of private ssh repositories.
