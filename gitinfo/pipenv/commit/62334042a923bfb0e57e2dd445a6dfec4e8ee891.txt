 **Pipenv** — the officially recommended Python packaging tool from `Python.org <https://packaging.python.org/new-tutorials/installing-and-using-packages/>`_, free (as in freedom).
 
-Pipenv is a project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_, and `virtualenv <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`_ into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors.
