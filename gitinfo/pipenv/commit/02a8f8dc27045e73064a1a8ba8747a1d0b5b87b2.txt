 A proper shell configuration only sets environment variables like ``PATH`` during a login session, not during every subshell spawn (as they are typically configured to do). In fish, this looks like this::
 
-if status --is-login
+    if status --is-login
 
-    set -gx PATH /usr/local/bin $PATH
+        set -gx PATH /usr/local/bin $PATH
 
-end
+    end
 
 You should do this for your shell too, in your ``~/.profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` or wherever appropriate.
