-A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
-==========================
-
-Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
-Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
-as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
-principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
-
-In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
-National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
-in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
-software.
-
-In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
-BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
-year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
-Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
-Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
-non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
-Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
-the PSF.
-
-All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
-the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
-releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
-the various releases.

-Footnotes:
-
-(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
-    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
-    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
-    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
-    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
-
-(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
-    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
-    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
-    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
-
-Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
-direction to make these releases possible.
