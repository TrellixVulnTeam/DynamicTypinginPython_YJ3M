-**Pipenv** is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_, and `virtualenv <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`_ into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors.

 It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your ``Pipfile`` as you install/uninstall packages. The ``lock`` command generates a lockfile (``Pipfile.lock``).
