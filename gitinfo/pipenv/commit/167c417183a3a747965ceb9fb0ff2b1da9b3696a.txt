+Run the tests
+-------------
+
+Three ways of running the tests are as follows:
+
+1. ``make test`` (which uses ``docker``)
+2. ``./run-tests.sh``
+3. Using pipenv::
+
+    pipenv install --dev
+    pipenv run py.test
+
+For the last two, it is important that your environment is setup correctly, and
+this may take some work, for example, on a specific Mac installation, the following
+steps may be needed::
+
+    # Make sure the tests can access github
+    if [ "$SSH_AGENT_PID" = "" ]
+    then
+       eval `ssh-agent`
+       ssh-add
+    fi
+
+    # Use unix like utilities, installed with brew,
+    # e.g. brew install coreutils
+    for d in /usr/local/opt/*/libexec/gnubin /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin
+    do
+      [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$d:"* ]] && PATH="$d:${PATH}"
+    done
+
+    export PATH

+    unset PIP_FIND_LINKS
