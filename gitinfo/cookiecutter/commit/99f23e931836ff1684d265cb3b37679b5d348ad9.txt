    * Configure release-drafter
    
    Release Drafter creates and updates draft release notes based
    on merged PRs and their labels. The bot is already enabled and
    does never make any releases, only updates the Draft on
    https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/releases
    
    * Update .github/labels.yml
