    Avoids tox/pip failures on old systems (#1192)
    
    Some systems may have older virtualenv versions which would install
    an ancient version of pip (like 8.1.1) which is not able to parse
    requirements correctly generating errors like:
    
    RequirementParseError: Expected ',' or end-of-list in pathlib2>=2.2.0;python_version<"3.6" at ;python_version<"3.6"
    You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 19.1.1 is available.
    
    We cannot really support such versions so we can assure that we
    only run with relatively newer tools.
    
    This should fixed observed AppVeyor errors.
