 1.1.0 (2015-09-26) Snickerdoodle
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
+The goals of this release were `copy without render` and a few additional command-line options such as `--overwrite-if-exists`, `â€”replay`, and `output-dir`.
+
 Features:
 
 * Added `copy without render`_ feature, making it much easier for developers of Ansible, Salt Stack, and other recipe-based tools to work with Cookiecutter. Thanks to `@osantana`_ and `@LucianU`_ for their innovation, as well as `@hackebrot`_ for fixing the Windows problems (#132, #184, #425).
