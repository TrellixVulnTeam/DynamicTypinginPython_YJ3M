 Building Python tools for platforms like mobile phones and set top boxes requires a lot of boilerplate code just to get the project running. Cookiecutter has enabled us to very quickly stub out a starter project in which running Python code can be placed, and makes maintaining those templates very easy. With Cookiecutter we've been able to deliver support `android devices`_, `iOS devices`_, tvOS boxes, and we're planning to add native support for iOS and Windows devices in the future.
