commit 64f14ac2b65e65cfc1a4d75c68bf6f6d318ce7cd
Author: Evan Palmer <evjpalmer@gmail.com>

    update docs, change references to 'repo_name'
    
    Since the project template dir doesn't have to
    be called 'repo_name' anymore, change occurrences
    of 'repo_name' to 'project_name', and clarify that
    this is a templated value. Remove note about v0.7.0
