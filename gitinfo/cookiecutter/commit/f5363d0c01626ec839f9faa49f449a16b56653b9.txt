    Improve Community docs to better address @freakboy3742's question about where to discuss/narrow down Cookiecutter problems.
    
    From Twitter: "Haven't got a well isolated issue suitable for a bug report yet; whats the best forum for discussing/narrowing down a problem?"
    
    @freakboy3742 if I can address this better in any other way, let me know. To be honest I'm still learning the ropes: this is my first open source project that has gotten far enough to even need a forum.

-If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask by `filing an issue`_ with your

-`contributors`_ who have pitched in to help make Cookiecutter an even better
-tool.
+* See the :doc:`troubleshooting` guide.
+* You are strongly encouraged to `file an issue`_ about the problem, even if
+  it's just "I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter" with a link to your
+  cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.
+* Ask for help on `Stack Overflow`_.
+* Ask for help in #cookiecutter if you must (but please try one of the other
+  options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion)
 
-Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the `contributing instructions`_, then
-get started.
+Development on Cookiecutter is community-driven:
 
-All members of the Cookiecutter community (end users, project template

+Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users in IRC:

+  `@audreyr`_ might not always be available)
+
+Show support:
+
+* Please, please join the `Cookiecutter Gittip community`_. We need more members.
+
+Got criticism or complaints?
+
+* `File an issue`_ so that Cookiecutter can be improved. Be friendly
+  and constructive about what could be better. Make detailed suggestions.
+* **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.** For example, if you are
+  discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list, `file an issue`_
+  where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc `audreyr@gmail.com` on
+  the email.
+* Be encouraging. A comment like "This function ought to be rewritten like
+  this" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like "Eww, look
+  how bad this function is."
+
+Waiting for a response to an issue/question?
+
+* Be patient and persistent. All issues are on `audreyr`_'s radar and will be
+  considered thoughtfully, but due to the growing to-do list/free time ratio,
+  it may take time for a response. If urgent, it's fine to ping `audreyr`_
+  in the issue with a reminder.
+* Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc.
+* Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours.
+* Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait? `audreyr`_ is
+  available hourly for consultation or custom development.

+Troubleshooting
+===============
+
+I created a cookiecutter, but it doesn't work, and I can't figure out why
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+* Try the latest development version of Cookiecutter, which prints better error
+  messages and has fixes for several common bugs.
+  
+  .. note:: This is a temporary solution; the upcoming 0.7.0 release will be
+     out shortly. Please be patient, as I'm rushing to get this ready during my
+     limited free time. -- `@audreyr`_

+
+I'm having trouble generating Jinja templates from Jinja templates
+------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Make sure you escape things properly, like this::
+
+    {{ "{{" }}
+
+Or this::
+
+    {% raw %}
+    <p>Go <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Home</a></p>
+    {% endraw %}
+
+Or this::
+
+    {{ {{ url_for('home') }} }}
+
+See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#escaping for more info.
+
+Other common issues
+-------------------
+
+TODO: add a bunch of common new user issues here.
+
+This document is incomplete. If you have knowledge that could help other users,
+adding a section or filing an issue with details would be greatly appreciated.
