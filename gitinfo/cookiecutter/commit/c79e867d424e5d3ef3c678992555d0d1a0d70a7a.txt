 1. Fork the `cookiecutter` repo on GitHub.
 2. Clone your fork locally:
 
-```
-    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/cookiecutter.git
-```
+    ```bash
+        git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/cookiecutter.git
+    ```
 
 3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:
- ```
-    $ mkvirtualenv cookiecutter
-    $ cd cookiecutter/
-    $ python setup.py develop
- ```
+
+    ```bash
+        mkvirtualenv cookiecutter
+        cd cookiecutter/
+        python setup.py develop
+    ```
 
 4. Create a branch for local development:
 
-```
-    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
+```bash
+    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
 ```
 
 Now you can make your changes locally.
 
 5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests and flake8:
 
-```
-    $ pip install tox
-    $ tox
+```bash
+    pip install tox
+    tox
 ```
 
 Please note that tox runs flake8 automatically, since we have a test environment for it.
 
 If you feel like running only the flake8 environment, please use the following command:
-```
-    $ tox -e flake8
+
+```bash
+    tox -e flake8
 ```
 
 6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
-```
-    $ git add .
-    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
-    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
-```
 
-7. Check that the test coverage hasn't dropped::
+```bash
+    git add .
+    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
+    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
 ```

--   Support for pre-generate and post-generate hooks, thanks to [\@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/). Hooks are Python or shell scripts that run before and/or after your project is generated.
--   Support for absolute paths to cookiecutters, thanks to [\@krallin](https://github.com/krallin/).
--   Support for Mercurial version control system, thanks to [\@pokoli](https://github.com/pokoli/).

 Building Python tools for platforms like mobile phones and set top boxes requires a lot of boilerplate code just to get the project running. Cookiecutter has enabled us to very quickly stub out a starter project in which running Python code can be placed, and makes maintaining those templates very easy. With Cookiecutter we've been able to deliver support [Android devices](https://github.com/beeware/Python-Android-template), [iOS devices](https://github.com/beeware/Python-iOS-template), tvOS boxes, and we're planning to add native support for iOS and Windows devices in the future.
