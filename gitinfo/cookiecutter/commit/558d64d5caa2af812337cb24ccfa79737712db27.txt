 Available Cookiecutters
 -----------------------
 
-Here is a list of **cookiecutters** (aka Cookiecutter project templates) for you to use or fork.
+Making great cookies takes a lot of cookiecutters and contributors. We're so
+pleased that there are many Cookiecutter project templates to choose. We hope
+you find a cookiecutter that is just right for your needs.

+Community
+---------
+
+The core committer team is `@audreyr`_, `@pydanny`_, `@michaeljoseph`_,
+`@pfmoore`_, and `@hackebrot`_. We
+welcome you and invite you to participate.
+
+Stuck? Try one of the following:
+
+* See the `Troubleshooting`_ page.
+* Ask for help on `Stack Overflow`_.
+* You are strongly encouraged to `file an issue`_ about the problem, even if
+  it's just "I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter" with a link to your
+  cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.
+* Ask for help on `Gitter`_ if you must (but please try one of the other
+  options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion)
+
+Development on Cookiecutter is community-driven:
+
+* Huge thanks to all the `contributors`_ who have pitched in to help make
+  Cookiecutter an even better tool.
+* Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the `contributing instructions`_,
+  then get started.
+
+Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users on `Gitter`_:
+
+* https://gitter.im/audreyr/cookiecutter (note: due to work and commitments,
+  a core committer might not always be available)
+
+Encouragement is unbelievably motivating. If you want more work done on
+Cookiecutter, show support:
+
+* Thank a core committer for their efforts.
+* Star `Cookiecutter on GitHub`_.
+* Join the `Cookiecutter Gittip community`_.
+
+Got criticism or complaints?
+
+* `File an issue`_ so that Cookiecutter can be improved. Be friendly
+  and constructive about what could be better. Make detailed suggestions.
+* **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.** For example, if you are
+  discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list, `file an issue`_
+  where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on
+  the email.
+* Be encouraging. A comment like "This function ought to be rewritten like
+  this" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like "Eww, look
+  how bad this function is."
+
+Waiting for a response to an issue/question?
+
+* Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar and
+  will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through. If
+  urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder.
+* Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc.
+* Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours.
+* Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait? `@audreyr`_ is
+  available for hire for consultation or custom development.
