+Additional Features in 0.7.0
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+0.7.0 is not out yet, but these features are in the master branch:
+
+* Cross-platform support for `~/.cookiecutterrc` files:
+
+    default_context:
+        full_name: "Audrey Roy"
+        email: "audreyr@gmail.com"
+        github_username: "audreyr"
+    cookiecutters_dir: "~/.cookiecutters/"
+
+* Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into
+  `~/.cookiecutters/` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.
+
+* In addition to git repos, you can also use cookiecutters directly from
+  Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.
+
+* Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults
+  whenever you generate a project
+
+* Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after
+  generating a project.
+
+* Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.
+
+* Projects are always generated to your current directory.
