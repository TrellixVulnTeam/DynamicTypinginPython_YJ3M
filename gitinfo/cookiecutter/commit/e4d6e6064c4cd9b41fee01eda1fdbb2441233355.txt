+  major change from the pre-0.7.0 behavior, where cloned cookiecutters were
+  deleted at the end of project generation.)
+* Support for --checkout argument.
+* Support for pre-generate and post-generate hooks, which are Python or shell
+  scripts that run before and/or after your project is generated.
+
+0.7.1
++++++
+
+This is a patch release to fix minor bugs and any potential problems with 0.7.0.
