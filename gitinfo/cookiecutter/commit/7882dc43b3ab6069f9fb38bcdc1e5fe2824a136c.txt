+Replay Project Generation
+-------------------------
+
+*New in Cookiecutter 1.1*
+
+On invocation **Cookiecutter** dumps a json file to ``~/.cookiecutter_replay/`` which enables you to *replay* later on.
+
+In other words, it persists your **input** for a template and fetches it when you run the same template again.
+
+Example for a replay file (which was created via ``cookiecutter gh:hackebrot/cookiedozer``)::
+
+    {
+        "cookiecutter": {
+            "app_class_name": "FooBarApp",
+            "app_title": "Foo Bar",
+            "email": "raphael@hackebrot.de",
