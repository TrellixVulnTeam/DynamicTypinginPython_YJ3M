+Upgrading from 0.6.4 to 0.7.0
+-----------------------------
+
+First, read :doc:`history` in detail. There are a lot of major
+changes. The big ones are:
+
+* Cookiecutter no longer deletes the cloned repo after generating a project.
+* Cloned repos are saved into `~/.cookiecutters/`. 
+* You can optionally create a `~/.cookiecutterrc` config file.
+
+Upgrade Cookiecutter with one of the following:
+
+    $ easy_install --upgrade cookiecutter
+    $ [sudo] pip install -U cookiecutter
+
+Then you should be good to go.
