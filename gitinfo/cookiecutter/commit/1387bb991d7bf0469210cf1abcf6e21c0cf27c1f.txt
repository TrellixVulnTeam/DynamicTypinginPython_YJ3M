-On Windows, ensure the ``c:\Python3x`` directory is in your environment's ``Path``, where ``x`` is the minor version of installed Python, in order to make it possible to invoke Python from a command prompt by typing ``python``. You will also need to add your ``bin`` folder. To do so:
 
-#. Right click ``My Computer``
-#. Select ``Properties`` --> ``Advanced Tab`` --> ``Environment Variables``
-#. Add each directory to the end of the ``Path`` environment variable, one for your Python interpreter and another for your ``bin`` folder.

+Ensure the directory where cookiecutter will be installed is in your environment's ``Path`` in order to make it possible to invoke it from a command prompt. To do so, search for "Environment Variables" on your computer (on Windows 10, it is under ``System Properties`` --> ``Advanced``) and add that directory to the ``Path`` environment variable, using the GUI to edit path segments.
+
+Example segments should look like ``%APPDATA%\Python\Python3x\Scripts``, where you have your version of Python instead of ``Python3x``.

+You may need to restart your command prompt session to load the environment variables.
