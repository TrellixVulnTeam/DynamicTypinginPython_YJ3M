+## 1.7.1 (2019-04-22)
+
+This release was focused on internal code and CI/CD changes. During this release
+all code was verified to match pep8, pep257 and other code-styling guides.  
+Project CI/CD was significantly changed, Windows platform checks based on Appveyor
+engine was replaced by GitHub actions tests. Appveyor was removed. Also our
+CI/CD was extended with Mac builds, to verify project builds on Apple devices.
