+The goal of this release was to allow for injection of extra context via the
 Cookiecutter API, and to fix minor bugs.
 
 Features:
 
 * `cookiecutter()` now takes an optional `extra_context` parameter, thanks to `@michaeljoseph`_, `@fcurella`_, `@aventurella`_, `@emonty`_, `@schacki`_, `@ryanolson`_, `@pfmoore`_, `@pydanny`_, `@audreyr`_ (#260).
-* TODO if any other features were added post-0.7.2, add them here.
+* Context is now injected into hooks, thanks to `@michaeljoseph`_ and `@dinopetrone`_.
+* Moved all Python 2/3 compatability code into `cookiecutter.compat`, making the eventual move to `six` easier, thanks to `@michaeljoseph`_ (#60, #102).
+* Added `cookiecutterrc` defined aliases for cookiecutters, thanks to `@pfmoore`_ (#246)
+* Added `flake8` to tox to check for pep8 violations, thanks to `@natim`_.
 
 Bug Fixes:
 
 * Newlines at the end of files are no longer stripped, thanks to `@treyhunner`_ (#183).
 * Cloning prompt suppressed by respecting the `no_input` flag, thanks to `@trustrachel`_ (#285)
-* TODO go through post-0.7.2 commits and add bug fixes here.
+* With Python 3, input is no longer converted to bytes, thanks to `@uranusjr `_ (#98).
