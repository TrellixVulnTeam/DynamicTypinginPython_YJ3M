+Types of Contributions
+----------------------
+
+You can contribute in many ways:
+
+Create Cookiecutter Templates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Some other Cookiecutter templates to list in the :ref:`README <readme>` would
+be great.
+
+If you create a Cookiecutter template, submit a pull request adding it to
+README.rst.
+
+Report Bugs
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Report bugs at https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/issues.
+
+If you are reporting a bug, please include:
+
+* Your operating system name and version.
+* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
+* If you can, provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
+* If you don't have steps to reproduce the bug, just note your observations in
+  as much detail as you can. Questions to start a discussion about the issue
+  are welcome.
+
+Fix Bugs
+~~~~~~~~
+
+Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
+is open to whoever wants to implement it.
+
+Implement Features
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
+is open to whoever wants to implement it.
+
+Write Documentation
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Cookiecutter could always use more documentation, whether as part of the 
+official Cookiecutter docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
+articles, and such.
+
+Submit Feedback
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
+https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/issues.
+
+If you are proposing a feature:
+
+* Explain in detail how it would work.
+* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
+* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
+  are welcome :)
+
+Setting Up the Code for Local Development
+-----------------------------------------
+
+Here's how to set up `cookiecutter` for local development.
+
+1. Fork the `cookiecutter` repo on GitHub.
+2. Clone your fork locally::
+
+    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/cookiecutter.git
+
+3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::
+
+    $ mkvirtualenv cookiecutter
+    $ cd cookiecutter/
+    $ python setup.py develop
+
+4. Create a branch for local development::
+
+    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
+
+Now you can make your changes locally.
+
+5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests and flake8::
+
+    $ flake8 cookiecutter tests
+    $ python setup.py test
+    $ tox
+
+6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::
+
+    $ git add .
+    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
+    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
+
+7. Check that the test coverage hasn't dropped::
+
+    coverage run --source cookiecutter setup.py test
+    coverage report -m
+    coverage html
+
+8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
+Contributor Guidelines
+=======================
+
+Pull Request Guidelines
+-----------------------
+
+Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:
+
+1. The pull request should include tests.
+2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
+   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
+   feature to the list in README.rst.
+3. The pull request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and PyPy. Check
+   https://travis-ci.org/audreyr/cookiecutter/pull_requests and make sure that
+   the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
+
+Coding Standards
+-----------------
+
+TODO
+
+Tips
+----
+
+To run a particular test::
+
+    $ python -m unittest tests.test_find.TestFind.test_find_template
+
+To run a subset of tests::
+
+    $ python -m unittest tests.test_find
+
+Troubleshooting for Contributors
+---------------------------------
+
+Python 3.3 tests fail locally
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Try upgrading Tox to the latest version. I noticed that they were failing
+locally with Tox 1.5 but succeeding when I upgraded to Tox 1.7.1.
+
+Core Committer Guide
+====================
+
+.. warning:: This is an early draft and will likely change a lot.
+
+Vision and Scope
+-----------------
+
+To help guide us and limit the project from growing infinitely.
+
+TODO
+
+Process: Pull Requests
+------------------------
+
+If a pull request is untriaged:
+
+* Look at the roadmap
+* Set it for the milestone where it makes the most sense
+* Add it to the roadmap
+
+Milestones:
+
+* Follow semantic versioning. See http://semver.org
+* If a milestone contains too many pull requests, move some to the next milestone.
+
+How to prioritize pull requests, from most to least important:
+
+#. Fixes for broken tests. Broken means broken on any supported platform or Python version.
+#. Minor edits to docs.
+#. Bug fixes.
+#. Major edits to docs.
+#. Features.
+
+Process: Issues
+----------------
+
+If an issue is a bug that needs an urgent fix, mark it for the next patch release.
+Then either fix it or mark as please-help.
+
+Responsibilities
+-----------------
+
+#. Give priority to bug fixes over new features. This includes fixes for the Windows tests that broke at some point.
+#. Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
+#. Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2
+#. Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
+#. Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
+#. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct (https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
+
+Becoming a Core Committer
+--------------------------
+
+Contributors may be given core commit privileges. Preference will be given to those with:
+
+A. Past contributions to Cookiecutter and other open-source projects. Contributions to Cookiecutter include both code (both accepted and pending) and friendly participation in the issue tracker. Quantity and quality are considered.
+B. A coding style that I find simple, minimal, and clean.
+C. Access to resources for cross-platform development and testing.
+D. Time to devote to the project regularly.
