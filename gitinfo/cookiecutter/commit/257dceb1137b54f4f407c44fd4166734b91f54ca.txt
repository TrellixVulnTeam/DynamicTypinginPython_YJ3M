 Advanced Usage
 ==============
 
+Using Pre/Post-Generate Hooks
+-----------------------------
+
+You can have Python or Shell scripts that run before and/or after your project
+is generated. 
+
+Put them in `hooks/` like this::
+
+    cookiecutter-something/
+    ├── {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/
+    ├── hooks
+    │   ├── pre_gen_project.py
+    │   └── post_gen_project.py
+    └── cookiecutter.json
+
+Shell scripts work similarly::
+
+    cookiecutter-something/
+    ├── {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/
+    ├── hooks
+    │   ├── pre_gen_project.sh
+    │   └── post_gen_project.sh
+    └── cookiecutter.json
+
+It shouldn't be too hard to extend Cookiecutter to work with other types of
+scripts too. Pull requests are welcome.
