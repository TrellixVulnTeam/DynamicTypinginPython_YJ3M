+--------------------

+You can also distribute cookiecutter templates as Zip files. To use a Zip file
+template, point cookiecutter at a Zip file on your local machine::
+
+    $ cookiecutter /path/to/template.zip
+
+Or, if the Zip file is online::

+If the template has already been downloaded, or a template with the same name

+
+The Zip file contents should be the same as a git/hg repository for a template -
+that is, the zipfile should unpack into a top level directory that contains the
+name of the template. The name of the zipfile doesn't have to match the name of
+the template - for example, you can label a zipfile with a version number, but
+omit the version number from the directory inside the Zip file.
+
+If you want to see an example Zipfile, find any Cookiecutter repository on Github
+and download that repository as a zip file - Github repository downloads are in
+a valid format for Cookiecutter.
