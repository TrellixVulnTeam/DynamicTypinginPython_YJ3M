-    Buffers act as temporary stores for counters. The default implementation is just a passthru and
-    does not actually buffer anything.
-
-    A useful example might be a Redis buffer. Each time an event gets updated, we send several
-    add events which just store a key and increment its value. Additionally they fire off a task
-    to the queue. That task eventually runs and gets the current update value. If the value is
-    empty, it does nothing, otherwise it updates the row in the database.
-
-    This is useful in situations where a single event might be happening so fast that the queue cant
-    keep up with the updates.
+    Quotas handle tracking a project's event usage (at a per minute tick) and
+    respond whether or not a project has been configured to throttle incoming
+    events if they go beyond the specified quota.
