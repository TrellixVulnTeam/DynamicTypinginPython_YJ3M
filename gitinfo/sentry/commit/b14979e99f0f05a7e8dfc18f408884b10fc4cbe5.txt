    fix(supeuser): Fix redirect from old stream to new issues (#12116)
    
    This happens for sentry10 (and generally superusers) when accessing old dashboard URL (e.g. /sentry/), it attempts to render `<NoProjectsMessage>` which renders its child if you are a superuser and have access to a project. This will throw an error because it did not have a child and would not redirect.
