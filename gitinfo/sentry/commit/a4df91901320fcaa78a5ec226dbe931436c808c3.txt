commit a4df91901320fcaa78a5ec226dbe931436c808c3
Author: Mark Story <mark@sentry.io>
Date:   Fri Jul 12 17:03:55 2019 -0400

    ref(ui) Remove redundant prefix on orgnizationMonitors directory (#13996)
    
    The additional prefix doesn't add much as there is no project based
    monitors.
    
    Fixes SEN-747
