    fix(ui) Fix stars reverting state (#10252)
    
    Because updates are being done via reflux, but the project list page is
    not using reflux the ProjectItem re-render would see the props from the
    initial page load, and revert itself.
    
    Given that we don't have a way to display errors if/when starring
    a project fails I felt it was best to rely on the optimisitic state
    updates.
