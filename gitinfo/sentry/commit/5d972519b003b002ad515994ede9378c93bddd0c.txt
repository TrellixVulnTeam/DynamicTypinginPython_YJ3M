    fix: Gravatar fallback resulted in an invalid url
    
    Would end up getting `?d=undefined` which causes Gravatar to redirect
    into a non-https url, and breaking out https from a Mixed Content
    warning. The intended behavior is to just render the transparent "blank"
    avatar.
    
    I dunno what I'm doing, but the behavior seems to have changed in
