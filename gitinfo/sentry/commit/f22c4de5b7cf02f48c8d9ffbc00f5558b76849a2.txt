-If your platform supports it, block level context should also be available::
+You should also provide relevant contextual interfaces. These should last for the lifecycle of a request, and the general interface is "bind some kind of context", and then at the end of a request lifecycle, clear any present context.
+
+This interface consists of *_context methods, as well as a "clear context" method. The following is an example API which is implemented in most clients:

+::
+
+    # Bind sentry.interfaces.User
+    client.user_context({
+        'email': 'foo@example.com',
+    })
+
+    # Merge in additional tag context

+- http_context(data) -- bind sentry.interfaces.Http
+- wsgi_context(env) -- bind http_context based on a wsgi environment
