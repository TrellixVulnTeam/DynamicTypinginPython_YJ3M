    fix(ui) Fix PanelTable overflows in safari (#19543)
    
    Safari isn't so great at CSS grid, and handles resizing content and
    overflows with poorer results than other browsers. Having an overflow
    lets safari to apply scrollbars when it can't resize content. This also
    solves layout problems in very narrow viewports for other browsers.
