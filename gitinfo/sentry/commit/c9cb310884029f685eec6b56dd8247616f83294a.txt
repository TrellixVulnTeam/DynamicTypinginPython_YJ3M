    feat(Commits): Use tracing to log values (#18548)
    
    A bug was reported that there are duplicate suggested commits/assignees. This is difficult to replicate in a local environment. Attempted to use logging but got reverted because the data structures were too large for our internal logging infrastructure. This PR adds logging through Sentry tracing instead.
