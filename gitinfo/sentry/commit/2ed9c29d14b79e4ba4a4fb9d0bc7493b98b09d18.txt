    fix(jira) Improve setup instructions (#13368)
    
    Users often get stuck in login loops when trying to configure Jira as
    their browsers block 3rd party cookies. Unfortunately our integration
    setup relies on those. Hopefully by notifying users of that precondition
    more folks will be able to complete setup successfully.
