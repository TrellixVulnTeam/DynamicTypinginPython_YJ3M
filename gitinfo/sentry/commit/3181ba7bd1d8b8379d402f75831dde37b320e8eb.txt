 DESCRIPTION = """
-Define a relationship between Sentry and GitHub.
-
- * Authorize repositories to be added for syncing commit data.
- * Create or link existing GitHub issues. (coming soon)
+Connect your Sentry organization into your GitHub organization or user account.
+Take a step towards augmenting your sentry issues with commits from your
+repositories ([using releases](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/releases/)) and
+linking up your GitHub issues and pull requests directly to issues in Sentry.
+
+ * Create and link Sentry issue groups directly to a GitHub issue or pull
+   request in any of your repositories, providing a quick way to jump from
+   Sentry bug to tracked issue or PR!
+
+ * Authorize repositories to be added to your Sentry organization to augmenting
+   sentry issues with commit data with [deployment
+   tracking](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/releases/).
