 Sentry installs a command line script under the name ``sentry``. This will allow you to
 perform most required operations that are unachievable within the web UI.
 
+If you're using a non-standard configuration location, you'll need to prefix every command with
+--config (excluding init, which is a special case). For example::
+
+    sentry --config=/etc/sentry.conf.py help
+
 For a list of commands, you can also use ``sentry help``, or ``sentry [command] --help``
 for help on a specific command.
