    Don't wrap plugin.get_event_preprocessors in transaction
    
    This creates a transaction for every single plugin just to check if it
    has any preprocessors. This is a bunch of overhead and lots of room for
    failure considering we just return a simple list.
    
    It also accounts for a lot of these:
