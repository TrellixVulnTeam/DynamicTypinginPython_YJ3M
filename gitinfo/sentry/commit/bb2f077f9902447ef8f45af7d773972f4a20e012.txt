+Utilizing the Queue
+===================
+
+Sentry comes with a built-in queue to process tasks in a more asynchronous
+fashion. For example, with workers enabled, when an event comes in instead
+of writing it to the database immediately, it sends a job to the queue so
+that the request can be returned right away, and the background workers
+handle actually saving that data.
+
+Run a Worker
+------------
+
+Workers can be run by using the Sentry CLI. Specifically, you pass the 'worker'
+service to the start command::
+
+    sentry start worker
+
+Enable the Queue
+----------------
+
+Once you've brought up a worker, the next step is to enable the queue. This is
+done with a simple settings flag::
+
+    SENTRY_USE_QUEUE = True
