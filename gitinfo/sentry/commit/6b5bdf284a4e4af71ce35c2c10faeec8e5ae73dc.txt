    Cap Celery version to prevent kombu version conflict
    
    In Celery 3.1.19 (which is within the `celery>=3.1.8,<3.2.0` range specified in setup.py), the requirements for kombu have changed from `kombu>=3.0.25,<3.1` to `kombu>=3.0.29,<3.1` (see https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/v3.1.19/requirements/default.txt), which are in conflict with the `kombu<3.0.27` in Sentry's setup.py. Since the latter version is pinned due to breaking Django 1.6 compatibility, the required Celery version needs to be capped at 3.1.18 for a clean installation to work.
