    chore(ui): Fix cryptic react warning in congrats video (#17201)
    
    By removing the `muted` prop on the video tag we get rid of a cryptic
    react error:
    
    > unstable_flushDiscreteUpdates: Cannot flush updates when React is already rendering
    
    See: https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/2326
    
    This is likely only in tests, but we don't really need the muted prop,
    as the video has no audio track anyway.
