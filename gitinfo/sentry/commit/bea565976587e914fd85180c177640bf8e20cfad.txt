    chore(react): Upgrade to react@16.3.2 (#8444)
    
    I think this is pretty safe to upgrade, features include:
    
    * `createRef` API - we could update our string refs with this more easily than the callback API
    * `forwardRef` API - this would be useful when dealing with styled and functional components when you want a ref to reference a specific child component.
    * `getDerivedStateFromProps` - replaces some of our usage of `cWRP`
    * new Context API
