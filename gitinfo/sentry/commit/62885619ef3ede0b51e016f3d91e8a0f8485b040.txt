+Health Checks
+=============
+
+Sentry provides several ways to monitor the system status. This may be as simply
+as "is the backend serving requests" to more in-depth and gauging potential
+configuration problems. In some cases these checks will be exposed in the UI
+though generally only to superusers.
+
+The following endpoint is exposed to aid in automated reporting:
+
+::
+
+    http://sentry.example.com/_health/
+
+
+Generally this is most useful if you're using it as a health check in something
+like HAProxy.
+
+That said, we also expose additional checks via the same endpoint by passing
+``full=1``:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ curl -i http://sentry.example.com/_health/?full=1
+    HTTP/1.0 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR
+    Content-Type: application/json
+
+    {
+      "problems":  [
+        "Background workers haven't checked in recently. This can mean an issue
+         with your configuration or a serious backlog in tasks."
+      ]
+    }
