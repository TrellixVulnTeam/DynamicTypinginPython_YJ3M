 Configuration
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
+An Install Wizard has been added to aid in configuring necessary first-run options. Notably your Admin Email, and URL Prefix. The Installation Wizard will also help any future updates and aid when new options are introduced.
+
 A new configuration backend is now utilized for several options. These options can now be
 configured via the web UI.
 
+A new configuration file, `config.yml` has been introduced. This new file is generated during `sentry init` the first time, and expected to be pointed at a directory. `config.yml` is the home for new configuration options that will be moved from the existing python config file.
+
+``SENTRY_URL_PREFIX`` has been deprecated, and moved to `system.url-prefix` inside of `config.yml` or it can be configured at runtime.
