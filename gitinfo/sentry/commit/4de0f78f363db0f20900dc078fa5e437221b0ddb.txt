    Fix off by one in release + environment graphs. (#4102)
    
    This is related to original issue in GH-4076 and was made observable by
    the "almost flawless" GH-4087.
    
    The 30 day graph returned by the issue details endpoint returns 31 days,
    and the 24 day graph returns 25 days. This makes the
    `GroupEnvironmentWithStatsSerializer` and
    `GroupReleaseWithStatsSerializer` respect that behavior as well, so the
    two graphs can be zipped together properly.
