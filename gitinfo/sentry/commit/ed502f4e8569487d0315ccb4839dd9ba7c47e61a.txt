    feat(Integrations): Update Bitbucket scopes (#18504)
    
    Objective
    We received the following notice from Bitbucket about changing scopes. We re-confirmed with the Bitbucket dev team that "Existing installations will continue to work as is, new installations will be affected." We are adding the repository scope to the Bitbucket integration so that we can continue making webhooks.
