-Sentry Client Changes
----------------------
-
-As of 1.13.0 the built-in client has been deprecated. A new standalone project (which doesn't require Django)
-called `Raven <http://github.com/dcramer/raven>`_ will replace it. If you're just getting started
-with Sentry, or you want to use a client in a non-Django application, we suggest taking a look at Raven.

+Uprading from 1.x
+-----------------
+
+If you are upgrading Sentry from a 1.x version, you should take note that the database migrations
+are much more significant than they were in the past. We recommend performing them **before**
+upgrading the actual Sentry server.
+
+As an example, all existing events need to be migrated to the new project structure. This means
+that every event gets backfilled with the new "default" project once it's created.
