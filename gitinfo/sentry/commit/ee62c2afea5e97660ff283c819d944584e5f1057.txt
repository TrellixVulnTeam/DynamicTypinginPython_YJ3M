-Additional Utilities
---------------------
-
-If you're familiar with Python you'll quickly find yourself at home, and
-even more so if you've used Django. The ``sentry`` command is just a
-simple wrapper around Django's ``django-admin.py``, which means you get
-all of the power and flexibility that goes with it.
-
-Some of those which you'll likely find useful are:
-
-createuser
-~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Quick and easy creation of superusers. These users have full access to the
-entirety of the Sentry server.
-
-runserver
-~~~~~~~~~
-
-Testing Sentry locally? Spin up Django's builtin runserver (or ``pip
-install django-devserver`` for something slightly better).
-
-
-Enabling Third Party Auth
--------------------------
-
-Most of the time it doesn't really matter **how** someone authenticates to
-the service, so much as it that they do. In these cases, Sentry provides
-integrating with several common services, including: Google and GitHub.
-Enabling this is as simple as setting up an application with the
-respective services, and configuring a couple values in your
-``sentry.conf.py`` file.
-
-By default, users will be able to both signup (create a new account) as
-well as associate an existing account. If you want to disable account
-creation, simply set the following value::
-
-  SENTRY_FEATURES = {
-    'social-auth:register': False,
-  }
-
-
-Google
-~~~~~~
-
-Register an application at
-http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html#Registering. Take
-the values given on the page, and configure the following::
-
-  GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID = ''
-  GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET = ''
-
-
-GitHub
-~~~~~~
-
-Register an application at https://github.com/settings/applications/new.
-Take the values given on the page, and configure the following::
-
-  GITHUB_APP_ID = ''
-  GITHUB_API_SECRET = ''
-
-For more information on configuring social authentication services,
-consult the `documentation on django-social-auth
-<https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth/>`_.
-
-
 What's Next?
 ------------
 
-There are several applications you may want to add to the default Sentry
-install for various security or other uses. This is a bit outside of the
-scope of normal (locked down) installs, as typically you'll host things on
-your internal network. That said, you'll first need to understand how you
-can modify the default settings.
-
-First pop open your ``sentry.conf.py``, and add the following to the
-**very top** of the file::
-
-  from sentry.conf.server import *
-
-Now you'll have access to all of the default settings (Django and Sentry)
-to modify at your own will.
-
-We recommend going over all of the defaults in the generated settings
-file, and familiarizing yourself with how the system is setup.
+At this point you should have a fully functional installation of Sentry. You
+may want to explore :doc:`various plugins <plugins>` available.
