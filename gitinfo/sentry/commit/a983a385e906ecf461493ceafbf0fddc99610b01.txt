    Fix: Fix django migrations conflict on master
    
    Looks like Django does actually care about these conflicts. This migration is an auto generated
    merge migration.

+    # Some things you should always mark as dangerous:
+    # - Adding indexes to large tables. These indexes should be created concurrently,
+    #   unfortunately we can't run migrations outside of a transaction until Django
+    #   1.10. So until then these should be run manually.
+    # - Large data migrations. Typically we want these to be run manually by ops so that
+    #   they can be monitored. Since data migrations will now hold a transaction open
+    #   this is even more important.
+    # - Adding columns to highly active tables, even ones that are NULL.
