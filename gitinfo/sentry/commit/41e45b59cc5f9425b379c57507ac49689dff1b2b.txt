    fix(issues) Allow selection of a single project to enable saved search (#11697)
    
    Requiring the user to select an issue via the checkbox is a strange
    workflow requirement for saving a new search. Instead we can use the
    global selector to know if only a single project is being operated on.
    
    I've also fixed a missing margin between buttons in the saved search
    modal.
    
    Fixes APP-1034
