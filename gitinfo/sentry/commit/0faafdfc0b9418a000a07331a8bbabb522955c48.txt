    Fix report graph display when either point is 0. (#3936)
    
    The intention of this if block was to ensure that a baseline was
    displayed when a segment was empty (e.g. sum of both points is 0) to
    avoid having a totally empty space where the filled bar would normally
    be, but this accidentally was showing a space when *either* point was 0.
