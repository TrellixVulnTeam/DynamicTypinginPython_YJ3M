    fix: Use default of None for SENTRY_ORGANIZATION
    
    Tests don't like relying on an org id of 1.
    
    I attempted to fix this in tests, but there are too many side effects
    related to fixtures and whatnot where tests fail. Turns out, relying on
    a fixed id is not ideal for tests.
