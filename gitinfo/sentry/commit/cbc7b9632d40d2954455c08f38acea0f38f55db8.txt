    fix(InstallWizard): Fix exception when InstallWizard completed (#14092)
    
    Since we don't have tests for the submit flow, we did not catch a regression from #13798 where the event handler was not bound to the class instance, causing an `this.setState` is not defined error when submitting the welcome form.
    
    This patch fixes the issue. Will add tests to cover this soon after.
