    test(js): `console.warn` for unmocked API endpoints (#15059)
    
    Previously we threw an error when we find an unmocked API endpoint in tests.
    However, this error generally gets caught in our app code since we generally handle API errors and thus we do not realize when we have incorrectly mocked an endpoint in our tests.
    
    This also means we will now have a lot of warnings in our test logs with unmocked endpoints that may not be relevant, but I think this is a fine tradeoff since this will save developer frustrations.
