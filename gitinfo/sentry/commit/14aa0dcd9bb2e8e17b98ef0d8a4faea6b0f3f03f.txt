+Is MySQL (or any database besides PostgreSQL) supported?
+
+    Sentry does not support any database besides PostgreSQL. While, for historical reasons, some
+    things may function, choosing to operate Sentry with an unsupported database will result in the
+    Sentry team being unable to provide support, and will result in support tickets and issues posted
+    to the public tracker being closed as ‘wontfix’
+
+    At a future time Sentry will be removing support entirely for any non-standard databases.
