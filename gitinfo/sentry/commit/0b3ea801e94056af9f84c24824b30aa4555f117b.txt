+Single Sign-On
+==============
+
+SSO in Sentry is handled in one of two ways:
+
+- Via a middleware which handles an upstream proxy dictating the authenticated user
+- Via a third party service which implements an authentication pipeline
+
+This documentation describes the latter, which would cover things like Google Apps, GitHub,
+LDAP, and other similar services.
+
+Enabling SSO
+------------
+
+As of version 8.0 the SSO feature is enabled by default in Sentry. That said it can be disabled
+with a feature switch in your ``sentry.conf.py``::
+
+    from sentry.conf.server import *
+
+    # turn SSO on our off
+    SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:sso'] = True
+
+You should see an **Auth** subheading under your organization's dashboard when SSO is enabled.
+
+Installing a Provider
+---------------------
+
+Providers are installed the same was as extensions. Simply install them via the Python package manager (pip)
+and restart the Sentry services. Once done you'll see them show up in the auth settings.
+
+The following providers are published and maintained by the Sentry team:
+
+* `Google Apps <https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-auth-google>`_
+* `GitHub <https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-auth-github>`_
+
