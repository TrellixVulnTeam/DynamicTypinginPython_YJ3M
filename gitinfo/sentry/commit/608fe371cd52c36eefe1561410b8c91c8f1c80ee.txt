    fix(ui): Added comment explaining usage of loadInitialData vs store actions #15634
    
    The Projects and Teams store are currently populated via direct calls to loadInitialData. Ideally we would use ProjectActions.loadProjects and TeamActions.loadTeams, but because OrganizationStore listens to those actions it would trigger multiple copies of the same organization and cause OrganizationContext to unnecessarily rerender multiple times. Once organization.projects and organization.teams does not exist we can safely change these store calls to use actions.
