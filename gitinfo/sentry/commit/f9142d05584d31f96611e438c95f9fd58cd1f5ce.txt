commit f9142d05584d31f96611e438c95f9fd58cd1f5ce
Author: Katie Byers <katie.byers@sentry.io>
Date:   Mon May 20 16:24:51 2019 -0700

    ref(roles): Change "owner" to "org owner" (#13077)
    
    Per SEN-598, rename "owner" role to "org owner." Also clarify places where "owner" actually means "issue owner," and do other language clean-up.
