commit 0018e3396f023e0da764d89afcb9a06d8fb168cd

    fix(ui) Use more consistent language for resolve by commit (#12921)
    
    In the issue details resolution info box we say 'resolved in commit',
    but on the activity stream for a group and organization we were using
    'fixed in commit'. This makes the language consistent prefering
    'resolved' as that is the status name we use everywhere else.
    
    Fixes FEEDBACK-381
