 *The plugin interface is a work in progress and the API is not frozen.**
 
-More and better docs coming soon.
+Several interfaces exist for extending Sentry:
+
+* Event Filters (sentry.filters)
+* Data Processors (sentry.processors)
+* Data Interfaces (sentry.interfaces)
+* Aggregate Views (sentry.views)
+* UI Plugins (sentry.plugins)
 
-.. note::
+Until we get sample docs up, it's suggested that you review the builtin plugins
+and the base classes to understand how the system works.
 
-   If you write a plugin be prepared to maintain it until we're content with the API.
+One thing to note, is that all extended methods (outside of data interfaces) should
+accept **kwargs to handle future changes.
 
+More and better docs coming soon.
