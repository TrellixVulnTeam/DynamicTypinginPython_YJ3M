    fix(ui) Remove blur from modal backdrop (#10560)
    
    A few customers have mailed in saying that the blur effect causes
    noticeable UI jank for them. I was unable to reproduce this on my
    machines, but it seems to acutely effect machines without dedicated GPU
    hardware. I'd like to try removing the blur to see if it noticeably
    improves the effected customer's experience.
    
    I've increased the opacity on the shade to help increase contrast with
    the modal. I've also removed filter() expressions that were targeting
    IE8 as we don't support that browser anymore.
