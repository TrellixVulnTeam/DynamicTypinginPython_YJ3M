    Don't kick to org create screen for super users if their activeorg isn't found (#4012)
    
    Not even sure why this logic made sense, but it was an awkward
    experience. Delete an organization while being a superuser, and you
    don't get kicked back to another organization you're a part of. You were
    left at the organization create page and had to url munge to get back to
    somewhere sensible.
