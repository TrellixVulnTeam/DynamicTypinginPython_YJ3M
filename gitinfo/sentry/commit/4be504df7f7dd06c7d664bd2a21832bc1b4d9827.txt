    feat(pagerduty): Remove uniqueness constraint on service_id cause we droppin it (#15423)
    
    Since we are dropping the service ID column in `pagerdutyservice`, first remove the uniqueness constraint.
    
    ## What's the SQL?
    ```
    BEGIN;
    ALTER TABLE "sentry_pagerdutyservice" DROP CONSTRAINT "sentry_pagerdutyservice_service_id_314dc4dbbd1c82f9_uniq";
    
    COMMIT;
    ```

+    #   this is even more important.
+    # - Adding columns to highly active tables, even ones that are NULL.
