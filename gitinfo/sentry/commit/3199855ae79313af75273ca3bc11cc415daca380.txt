 ## Preface
 
 Before you get around to actually turning on SSO, you'll want to keep in mind that once it's activated, all existing users will need to link their account before they are able to continue using Sentry. Because of that we recommend coordinating with your team during off-peak hours. That said, it's super quick to link accounts, so we don't consider it a true hurdle.
