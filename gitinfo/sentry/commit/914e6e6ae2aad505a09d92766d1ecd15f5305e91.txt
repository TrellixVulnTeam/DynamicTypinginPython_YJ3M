    fix(utils.sdk): Disable SentryInternalFilter (#19564)
    
    This filter invoked logic that is already being applied in the sentry sdk transport. As such it is not necessary to execute again. We also want to remove this filter because it impacts our ability to send to the upstream dsn (s4s), to which we can practically send anything.
    
    Let's try this out first, and if it works let's remove the logging filter for real.
