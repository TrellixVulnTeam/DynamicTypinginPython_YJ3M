-Version 8.23 (Unreleased)
--------------------------
-- Experimental implementation of Slack actions via a new Integrations and Identity API.

-- Group and ProjectGroupIndex endpoints now return AssignedTo as an object with the keys `id`, `type`, and `name`, instead of a full UserDetails object.
+Version 9.0 (Unreleased)
+------------------------
 
-Schema Changes
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+The changelog for Sentry 9 is summarized. For full details, we recommend reviewing the
+full set of SCM changes on GitHub. There are far too many changes to list in Sentry 9,
+but the major highlights are documented below.
 
-- Drop index on ``EventTag(project_id, key_id, value_id)``
-- Increased length of ``Release.ref`` and ``Release.version`` to 250
+There are also significant schema and data changes in this release, so plan for a huge amount
+of updates and a measurable increase in utilization of your data stores.
 
-API Changes
-~~~~~~~~~~~
-- Project plugins endpoint returns every configurable plugin, and includes additional information about each one
-- Added user "appearances" endpoint to list and modify appearance options.
-- Add endpoint to list a project's teams
-- Add endpoint for adding and removing team access from a project
+Note: Major features which are undocumented here should be considered unstable, and are almost
+certainly behind a feature switch which is intended to be disabled.
+
+Dashboard
+~~~~~~~~~
+
+We've removed the project-manager-esque dashboard and brought back a team/card based selection as
+as a new sidebar for quick access. We will continue to iterate on what projects mean in Sentry
+going forward and this is simply a first step towards future changes.
+
+Settings
+~~~~~~~~
+
+A new global settings UI has been introduced. This is an attempt to unify all settings and make
+it easier to find the numerous configuration options throughout Sentry.
+
+Environments
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Environments have been moved up in the hierarchy and are now a first class citizen. While
+still early, this is intended to replace the need for having separate projects per environment.
+
+To use environments you simply need to ensure you're configuring the ``environment`` parameter
+in the Sentry SDK, and it should automatically propagate into Sentry proper.
+
+Owners
+~~~~~~
+
+A new owners feature allows you to define per-project rules for declaring explicit ownership.
+Much like GitHub's .gitowners, this helps Sentry understand who is responsible for a specific
+issue, and more importantly lets you limit email alerts to only the relevant parties.
+
+In addition to explicit owners, the release framework has expanded to support implicit owners
+and suspect commits. This currently only works with GitHub.com hosted repositories, but will be
+expanded to support other providers in future versions of Sentry.
+
+Teams & Projects
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Projects can now be associated with many teams, and teams can be referenced in comments and
+assignment as well as the new ownership features.
+
+Both Team and Project names have been deprecated, and the short name as been promoted as the
+canonical reference. Teams can be mentioned using #team-name.
+
+Integrations
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The beginnings of the new integration framework (plugin v3) have landed, along with an initial
+version of a new Slack integration.
+
+The new integrations framework will likely change in upcoming versions of Sentry, and we dont
+suggest building against it yet.
+
+Some caveats:
+
+- The Slack integration requires Slack workspace tokens.
+- While there is some early work of other integrations in this release, they are not yet GA nor
+  are they exposed.
+
+API
+~~~
+
+Various portions of processing for the API will require additional dependencies and configuration
+(such as symbolic).
+
+- The 'secret key' for a DSN is no longer required and has been deprecated in SDKs.
+- Added support for Minidumps generated by Breakpad and Crashpad.
+- Added support for Cordova and Electron.
+- A new standard 'security report' endpoint has been exposed, which supports HKPK, CSP,
+  Expect-CT, and Expect-Staple reports.
+- Improved reprocessing feature.
+- Improved support for native Debug Symbols (Apple, Linux).
+- The ingestion API is now JSON-schema based (though still fairly flexible).
+- Added setup wizard for various SDKs (e.g. react-native).
+
+Privacy Changes
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+As part of GDPR, the open source version of Sentry now changes the default policy for its beacon
+(the service which tells sentry.io statistics about open source usage) to **not** send the system's
+contact email address by default. You can still opt-in to this, which will allow us to contact you
+in the event of a major security issue.
+
+Misc
+~~~~
+
+- User Feedback will now send an email notification.
+- Almost all major UI components are now driven by the client-side application.
+- Avatars have been added for organizations.
+- Various improvements to issue hashing, specifically for native (iOS) and javascript
+  applications.
+- Various improvements to Single Sign-On flows. You should update any external auth extensions
+  you're using as part of this (sentry-auth-github, sentry-auth-google).
+- Support for SAML via sentry-auth-saml2.
+- A new Assistant to help onboard users.
+- Add count estimates to search results.
+- Superuser has been locked down significantlly with idle timeouts and secondary sessions.
+- 2FA can now be enforced for an organization.
+- Various performance around event processing to make up for all the added load we're forcing on
+  ya'll. =)
