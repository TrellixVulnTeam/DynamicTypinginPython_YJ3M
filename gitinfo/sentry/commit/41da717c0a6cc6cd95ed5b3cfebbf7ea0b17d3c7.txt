    fix(discoverv2) - Cache even when project ids aren't passed
    
    - This is actually the most important case to cache, looks like
      projectIds aren't passed from discover's table view which meant the
      use_cache flag wasn't being passed in this case.
      - This should be fine since the api call is equivalent to what happens
        on the issues page, I missed this cause the issues Page passed an
        empty array instead of null.
