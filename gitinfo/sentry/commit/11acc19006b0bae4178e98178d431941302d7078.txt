+Permissions
+===========
+
+As described in the plugin interface, Sentry provides a large suite of permissions which all fire through the
+``has_perm`` extension point.
+
+In most cases, a superuser (that is, if User.is_superuser is ``True``), will be granted implicit permissions
+on everything. Additionally, several cases provide overrides via Django's standard permission system. All
+permissions are also bound to some level of inherint permission logic, such as projects only being editable
+by someone who has some level of control on that project.
+
+This page attempts to describe those permissions, and the contextual objects along with them.
+
+.. data: add_project
+
+         Controls whether a user can create a new project.

+
+.. data: edit_project
+
+         Controls whether a user can edit an existing project.
