    build(jest): Disable "verbose" to see console logs (#10307)
    
    If you've been writing frontend tests then I'm sure you've noticed your `console.log` output being gobbled up from stdout. It's due to a bug in jest with `verbose` mode enabled. I think this is a good temporary solution since I've seen many complaints about `console.log` output.
