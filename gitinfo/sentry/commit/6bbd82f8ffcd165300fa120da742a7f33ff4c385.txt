 Don't be worried by the amount of dependencies Sentry has. We have a philosophy of using the right tools for
 the job, and not reinventing them if they already exist.

+Installing from Source
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If you're installing the Sentry source (e.g. from git), you'll simply need to run the ``make`` command to
+get all of the dependencies::
+
+  # all things should be this easy
+  make
+
 Once everything's installed, you should be able to execute the Sentry CLI, via ``sentry``, and get something
 like the following::
 
   $ sentry
   usage: sentry [--config=/path/to/settings.py] [command] [options]
