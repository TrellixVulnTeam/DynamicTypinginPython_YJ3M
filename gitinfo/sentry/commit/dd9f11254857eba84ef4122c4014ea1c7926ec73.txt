    fix(ui): Fix LazyLoad error in Account Security (#10236)
    
    Because the children routes of `AccountSecurityWrapper` are code split and rendered with `app/components/LazyLoad`,
    there is a chance that the next child component is null while the bundle is being fetched.
    
    This is safe to return `null` while it is being fetched.
    
    Fixes JAVASCRIPT-48Q
