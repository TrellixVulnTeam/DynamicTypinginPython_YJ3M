    fix(github) Fix proptype warning in github issue link (#10511)
    
    The externaIssue identifier autocomplete had no default choices and
    React was emitting the following console error:
    
    ```
    Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `choices` is marked as required in `SelectField`, but its value is `undefined`.
       in SelectField (created by FieldFromConfig)
       in FieldFromConfig (created by ExternalIssueForm)
       in div (created by Form)
    ```
    
    Setting a default value fixes this problem.
