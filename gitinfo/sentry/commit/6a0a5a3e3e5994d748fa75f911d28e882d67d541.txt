    Added MS Teams Plugin Link to List
    
    Created an integration for Microsoft Teams chat system to send notifications and alerts. Similar to existing messaging tools like Slack etc.
    
    Takes a single parameter at this stage, just the WebHook URL created in MS Teams, and sends a notification with the culprit and a link back to the event that triggered the notification.
