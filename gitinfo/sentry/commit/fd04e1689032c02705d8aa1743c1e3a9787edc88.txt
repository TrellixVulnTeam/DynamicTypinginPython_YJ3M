    csp: hard block ms-browser-extension
    
    Similar to `about`, which was already blocked, reports that come through
    as `ms-browser-extension` aren't even a uri. The value is literally just
    that, meaning there's no other way for a user to block this.
    
    As a user brought up, this is not anything actionable and won't overlap
    with a valid report that someone would want to see since it's coming
    from an IE extension.
