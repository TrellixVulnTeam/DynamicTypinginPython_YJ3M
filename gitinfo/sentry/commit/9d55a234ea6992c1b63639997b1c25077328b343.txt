-Integrating with an existing Django install
--------------------------------------------
-
-The integrated setup is not recommended for production environments, but can be fairly easy to get up and running. It
-simply requires you to plug the Sentry application into your existing Django project. Once installed, you simply
-need to update your settings.py and add ``sentry``, ``dkombu``, and ``raven.contrib.django`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
-
-    INSTALLED_APPS = (
-        'django.contrib.admin',
-        'django.contrib.auth',
-        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
-        'django.contrib.sessions',
-
-        # Make sure you add all three required apps
-        'djkombu',
-        'sentry',
-        'raven.contrib.django',
-        ...
-    )
-
-.. note:: Raven is a seperate project, and the official Python client for Sentry.
-
-
-
-You will also need to add ``sentry.web.urls`` to your url patterns::
-
-    urlpatterns = patterns('',
-        (r'^sentry/', include('sentry.web.urls')),
-    )
-
-We also highly recommend setting ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG = True`` in your environment (not to be confused with ``DEBUG``). This will allow
-Sentry to receive template debug information when it hits a syntax error.
-
-Finally, run ``python manage.py syncdb`` to create the database tables.
-
-.. note::
-
-   We recommend using South for migrations. Initial migrations have already been created for Sentry in sentry/migrations/ so you only need to run ``python manage.py migrate sentry`` instead of ``syncdb``
