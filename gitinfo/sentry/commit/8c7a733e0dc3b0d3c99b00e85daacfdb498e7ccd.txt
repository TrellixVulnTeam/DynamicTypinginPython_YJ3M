    chore: Explicitly include `futures` in requirements (#8035)
    
    This previously was included as a transitive dependency somewhere, this
    makes it explicit. I think that this technically could be >=3.0.0 (we
    need the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue15015), but shinier is
    better, right?
