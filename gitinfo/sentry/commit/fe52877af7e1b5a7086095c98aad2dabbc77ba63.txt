    fix(ui): Make provider availibility sort stable
    
    Fix for #19185.
    
    Adding a second sort before the provider availability sort caused the provider availability sort to break the provider popularity sort results. So for the final sorted provider list, the providers were grouped by availability correctly but not consistently sorted in order of popularity. This change fixes that by making the first (availability) sort stable.
