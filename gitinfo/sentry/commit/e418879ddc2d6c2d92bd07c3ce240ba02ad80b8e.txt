    feat: Increase received events cache to 1 hour (#14363)
    
    Increase caching of received event IDs from 5 minutes to 1 hour.
    
    Motivation for this change:
    - We currently receive a large volume of duplicate events (~27 per second)
    - In future we will process all duplicate events received after this
    window in post processing
