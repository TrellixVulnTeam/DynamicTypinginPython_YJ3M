    docs: remove misleading instructions for running at a subpath
    
    * These docs implied that they somewhat work, and it's possible to make
    work with some effort, though, this is entirely not true.
    
    Fixes GH-5173 GH-1887

 Hosting Sentry at a Subpath
 ----------------------------
 
-.. Note:: This method is unsupported and untested by the Sentry team.
-
-If your web server is hosting several applications then hosting Sentry at '/' may not be feasible for you. It is possible to configure your webserver such that all traffic going to '/sentry' can be directed at Sentry and everything else can remain as is.
-
-
-Add the following to your ``SENTRY_WEB_OPTIONS``::
-
-    SENTRY_WEB_OPTIONS = {
-      # Host Sentry at /sentry
-      'mount': '/sentry=path/to/sentry/wsgi.py'
-      'manage-script-name': True
-    }
-
-If you call uWSGI directly, possibly from Supervisor, see :ref:`performance-web-server`.
-
-Edit the command used to start sentry by removing this option::
-
-    --wsgi-file getsentry/wsgi.py
-
-And adding these options::
-
-    --mount "/sentry=getsentry/wsgi.py" --manage-script-name
-
-**Nginx Configuration**
-
-Make the adjustment to the 'location' directive in Nginx's configuration file::
-
-    location '/' => location '/sentry'
-
-One rewrite is still required before the location block [#f1]_::
-
-    if ($http_referer ~ .com/sentry) {
-      rewrite /sentry/sentry/(.*)$ /sentry/$1 break;
-    }
-
-
-Subpath with Sentry's Default Webserver
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-
-This is a bit more involved and harder to debug because not only does Nginx have to know the new location to listen for, it also must do rewriting of the urls it sends to the Sentry's built in server because it knows nothing about you trying to host the application elsewhere.
-
-These are not full configurations, but abbreviated versions to highlight the differences from the main examples.
-
-**Nginx Configuration**::
-
-    server {
-
-      ...
-
-      if ($http_referer ~ .com/sentry) {
-        rewrite /_static/(.*)$ /sentry/_static/$1 break;
-        rewrite /sentry/sentry/(.*)$ /sentry/$1 break;
-      }
-
-      location /sentry {
-        ...
-      }
-
-      ...
-    }
-
-**Django Configuration**
-
-Your Sentry settings file ($SENTRY_CONF python file)::
-
-    ...
-
-    FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = '/sentry'
-    ...
-
-.. rubric:: Footnotes
-
-.. [#f1] Some URIs still don't play nice with hosting at a subpath so they need to be caught by Nginx. The known offender is the permalink for all events returned by the API.
+.. Note:: This method is unsupported and there is no proven way to
+          accomplish this. Please use a dedicated domain or subdomain.
