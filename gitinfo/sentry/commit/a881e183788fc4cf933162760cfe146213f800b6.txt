+A Note on Workers
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In the past it was supported to run Sentry's queue workers with the `-B` option to also spawn
+a celery beat process within the worker.  This is no longer supported as it causes problems in
+some queue setups (in particular if redis is being used).  Instead you should now spawn two
+independent processes.  This is outlined in the installation documentation.
