    fix(dashboard): Prevent users without team:admin from navigating to team (#8634)
    
    Users without team:admin permissions should not be able to navigate to team settings since they won't be able to perform any actions there. We'll render the team name as static text instead in that case.
    
    This is a partial fix for ISSUE-6
