+Queue Monitoring
+================
+
+The health of Sentry relies very heavily on passing messages through our queue
+and if the queue is backlogged, we will notify you through a message in the UI
+if you are a superuser.
+
+To monitor the health actively with an external tool such as collectd or Diamond,
+Sentry provides a CLI tool that returns machine parsable output.
