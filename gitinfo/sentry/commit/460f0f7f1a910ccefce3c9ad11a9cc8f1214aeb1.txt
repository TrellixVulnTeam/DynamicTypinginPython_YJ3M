    auth: Add a maximum length to passwords
    
    This comes up enough as a security issue that I'm going to fix it even
    though it's hardly a measurable issue for us.
    
    The argument is: without a limit here, the hashing algorithm can be
    exploited by giving it tons of data.
    
    For sentry.io, this limit is effectively set to 5MB, since that's the
    max file size that can be uploaded through normal requests. After
    testing, a password of this size has hardly any affect on us and would
    be _really_ hard to abuse via this vector. But regardless, to make
    people stop, it's unrealistic that anyone would have a password more
    than 256 characters and it just stops any potential here. 1Password's
    longest password it can generate is 64 characters, for example.
