    fix(ui) Fix graph navigation in event modal (#13718)
    
    The event details latest/oldest endpoints don't support a `group` query
    parameter. Instead the `issue.id` condition must be sent in the query
    text. I was using `group` because I made it work in an earlier prototype
    and then removed it when I saw tests for `issue.id` condition.
