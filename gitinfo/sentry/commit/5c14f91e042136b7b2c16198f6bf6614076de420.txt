    feat(Commits): Add logging to determine where duplicate commits are coming from (#18526)
    
    Objective
    A bug was reported that there are duplicate suggested commits/assignees. Both come the same endpoint. This is difficult to replicate in a local environment. We are adding logging so we can see what is going on inside the functions in a staging environment in ElasticSearch.
