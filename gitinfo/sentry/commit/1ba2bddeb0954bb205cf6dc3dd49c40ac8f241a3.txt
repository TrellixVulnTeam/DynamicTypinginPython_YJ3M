+Building Static Media
+---------------------
+
+Sentry is based on `Bootstrap <https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap>`_, which means its CSS files are compiled using
+LESS. You'll find the main file located in ``bootstrap/sentry.less``. Please note, that we **do not** modify Bootstrap,
+we only extend it.
+
+To compile media, just run ``make`` from the root directory. This will handle merging all existing JavaScript as well
+as building the CSS files.
