+Configure Outbound Mail
+-----------------------
+
+Several settings exist as part of the Django framework which will configure your outbound mail server. For the
+standard implementation, using a simple SMTP server, you can simply configure the following::
+
+    EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
+    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
+    EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
+    EMAIL_PORT = 25
+    EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
+
+Being that Django is a pluggable framework, you also have the ability to specify different mail backends. See the
+`official Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/email/?from=olddocs#email-backends>`_ for
+more information on alterantive backends.
