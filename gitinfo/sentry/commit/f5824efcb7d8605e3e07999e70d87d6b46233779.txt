    fix(charts): Set notMerge default to true for all charts (#9241)
    
    Having notMerge as false potentially causes charts to be incorrect,
    since echarts will try to merge previous options with new ones when
    props change. If props change and all the new series' received aren't
    exactly the same as the previous ones, incorrect charts might be
    rendered with both the old and new data on them.
