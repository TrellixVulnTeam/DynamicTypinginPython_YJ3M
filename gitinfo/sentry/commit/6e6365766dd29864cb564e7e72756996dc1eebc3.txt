+Version 3.6.0
+-------------
+
+This version focuses on improving mebership control. It includes the ability to revoke
+project members access temporarily (by suspending them), as well as revoking users
+(outside of Sentry) via the user.is_active flag.
+
+Additionally, it brings the beginnings of an "invite user" flow, allowing you to
+invite users who may or may not already have accounts in the system. We plan to improve
+this flow in an upcoming release to allow invitees easy registration within the system
+if they dont already have an account.

 Version 3.5.0
