commit 909297d408816f73e8152335fc59b9e249728db7

    fix(invites) Don't display projects on org invite page. (#11585)
    
    Showing the first a list of projects on the organization invite page
    creates the opportunity to leak information as the invited member may
    not have access to all the displayed projects. While we could filter
    down the projects to the only those the member will have access to, it
    is simpler to not mention projects at all.
    
    Fixes #11528
