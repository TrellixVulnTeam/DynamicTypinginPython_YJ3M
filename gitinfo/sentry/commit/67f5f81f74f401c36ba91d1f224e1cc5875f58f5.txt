 Version 6 of the protocol has been introduced. The only change is the addition of the `release` attribute.
 
 BIGINT
-======
+~~~~~~
 
 All integer fields have been replaced with bigint's. This migration is *not* automated (due to it causing locking) and if you need it locally you will need to sort out the migration on your own, as well as set `SENTRY_USE_BIG_INTS = True` in your configuration.
 
 Help Pages

 longer used, and the User model has been replaced with sentry.User.
