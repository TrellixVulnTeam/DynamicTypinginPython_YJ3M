    refs(alert_rules): Move incident related endpoints into the incidents module (#18956)
    
    I've been meaning to do this for a while, and since I'm already refactoring things this seems like a
    good time. This puts all incident related endpoints into the `incidents` module. This means that the
    majority of incidents code is located here. The only thing we're missing are the serializers, which
    are hard to move out due to how the api module is structured. We can likely refactor things there
    at some point so that we can get everything into the one place.
