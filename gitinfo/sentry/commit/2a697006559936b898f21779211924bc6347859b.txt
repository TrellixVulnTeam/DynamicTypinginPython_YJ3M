    test(acceptance): Fix flakey onboarding test (#16282)
    
    This test was only flakey in `django@1.10` - not sure what changed that would cause this (perhaps a perf regression in 1.10?), but this seems to fix the flake. I would love to understand what's going on, but it's not reproducible locally, so I'm not going to investigate further.
