    test(js): Fix flakey IssueList test due to `<NoGroupsHandler>` (#18009)
    
    This is a bit hacky, but this is causing flakiness in frontend tests
    `issueList/overview` is being unmounted during tests before the requests
    in `NoGroupsHandler.fetchSentFirstEvent` are completed and causing this React warning:
    
    ```
    Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.
    This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.
    To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the
    componentWillUnmount method.
    ```
