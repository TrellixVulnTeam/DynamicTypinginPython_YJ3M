commit a8614be6018831efe6155b3768c59c7aa171db89
Author: Matt Robenolt <matt@ydekproductions.com>

    fix(api): Release models need default counts
    
    Without this, since the default value is NULL, you can't increment NULL.
    This means if the instance is created without explicitly setting
    `commit_count=0` or `total_deploys=0`, in the future doing
    `total_deploys=F('total_deploys')+1` doesn't do anything, since `NULL+1`
    is still NULL.
    
    This does not require a database migration, since this value is simply
    used by Django.
