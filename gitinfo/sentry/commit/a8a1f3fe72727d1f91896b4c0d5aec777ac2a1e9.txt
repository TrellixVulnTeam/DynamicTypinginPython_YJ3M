    fix(similarity): Use interface attribute that exists (#12137)
    
    This was probably broken with GH-11078 but it's hard to tell for sure
    because the logger is disabled that reports feature extraction failure.
    This only really presents itself as a failure in development when
    bootstrapping an environment with `bin/load-mocks`.
