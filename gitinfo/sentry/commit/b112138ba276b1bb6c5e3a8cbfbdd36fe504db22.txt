commit b112138ba276b1bb6c5e3a8cbfbdd36fe504db22

    ref: Move releases sub-components into correct folder (#13005)
    
    Since GroupList, CommitAuthorStats and ReleaseProjectStatSparkLine
    components are only used within releases we should move them into
    the releases views folder. Since they are not broadly reused they
    shouldn't be classified as components.
