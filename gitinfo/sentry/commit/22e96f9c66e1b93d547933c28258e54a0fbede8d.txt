    style: Remove trailing slash from static symlink (#10045)
    
    This is very minor, but when symlinking a directory the trailing slash
    is not needed and makes the output of `ls -l --classify` look a little
    funny.
    
      $ ls -l --classify
      lrwxr-xr-x    1 evan staff     24 Oct  8 16:25 static -> src/sentry/static/sentry//
    
    Where as with it removed it does not have the trailing slash:
    
      $ ls -l --classify
      lrwxr-xr-x    1 evan staff     24 Oct  8 16:25 static -> src/sentry/static/sentry/
    
    Semantically it doesn't seem important [0].
