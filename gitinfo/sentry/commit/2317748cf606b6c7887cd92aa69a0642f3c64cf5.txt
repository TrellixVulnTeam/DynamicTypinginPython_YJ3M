 While Node Storage does not depend on any other component, it is rarely called directly.
 Events are bound to their node data by calling
-``Event.objects.bind_nodes(event_list, 'data')``. In most single use cases, ``[event]`` is
-supplied instead of an ``event_list``. The reason that we supply the ``bind_nodes`` with a
+``eventstore.bind_nodes(event_list, 'data')``. In single use cases, we can call
+``event.bind_node_data()``. The reason that we supply the ``bind_nodes`` with a
 list is to utilize any backend that may support a "multiget" command, which heavily reduces
 the round trip time that it takes to receive data for multiple nodes.
