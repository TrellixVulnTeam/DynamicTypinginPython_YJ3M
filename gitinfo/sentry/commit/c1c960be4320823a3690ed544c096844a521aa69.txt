    fix(discover): Fix down arrows in firefox at different zoom (#19639)
    
    Our down arrows for descending sort within tables have an issue in Firefox where they won't appear (and will be replaced with ellipsis) due to rotate, when at any zoom other than 100% (likely due to a transform calculation rounding error). Since the arrows are symmetric, scale(1, -1) should be identical, and since it doesn't modify the horizontal size of the element, stops this issue from occurring.
