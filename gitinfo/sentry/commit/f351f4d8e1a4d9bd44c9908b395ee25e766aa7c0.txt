    Following expected version naming convention
    
    The problem is that different versions of setuptools is normalizing it
    different. So if in the chance that we have different versions of
    setuptools installed in a cluster, some are reporting as '8.0.0rc1' and
    others as '8.0.0-rc1' and our internal version comparisons don't match.
