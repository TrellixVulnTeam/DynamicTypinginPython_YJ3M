    fix(settings): Fix inaccurate CSP help text (#10294)
    
    Currently, on this page: https://sentry.io/settings/sentry/sentry/security-headers/csp/ the help text for "Additional ignored sources" is copied over from "Additional Sensitive Fields" on this page: https://sentry.io/settings/sentry/sentry/, which is something totally different.
    
    Also, the example doesn't match what we say we need (newlines instead of commas).
