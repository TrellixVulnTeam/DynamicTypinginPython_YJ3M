    Add organization to project bootstrap FAQ answer
    
    The current code example in the How do I... section (http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/faq/index.html#how-do-i)
    results in an `organization.DoesNotExist: Team has no organization` exception (tested on 7.0.1);
    the patch creates an organization and links it to the project and the team.
