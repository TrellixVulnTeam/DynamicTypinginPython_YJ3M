+Worker Performance Issues
+-------------------------
+
+If you're running a worker configuration with a high concurrency
+level (> 4) we suggest decreasing it and running more masters.
+
+e.g. if you had something like:
+
+```
+numprocs=1
+command=celery worker -c 64
+```
+
+change it to:
+
+```
+numprocs=16
+command=celery worker -c 4
+```
