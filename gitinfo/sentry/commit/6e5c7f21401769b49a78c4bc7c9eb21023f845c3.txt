+Enable Update Buffers
+=====================
+
+Sentry provides the ability to buffer certain updates to events, such as counts and timestamps. This is
+extremely helpful if you have high concurrency, especially if they're frequently the same event.
+
+For example, if you happen to receive 100,000 events/second, and 10% of those are reporting a connection
+issue to the database (where they'd get grouped together), enabling a buffer backend will change things
+so that each count update is actually put into a queue, and all updates are performed at the rate of how
+fast the queue can keep up.
+
+Available Backends
+------------------
+
+Currently only a single bundled backend is available, built for Redis. 
+
+
+.. date:: sentry.buffer.redis.RedisBuffer
+
+Two specify a backend, simply modify the ``BUFFER`` and ``BUFFER_OPTIONS`` values in your configuration:
+
+::
+
+    SENTRY_BUFFER = 'sentry.buffer.base.Buffer'
+    SENTRY_BUFFER_OPTIONS = {}
+
+The Redis Backend
+-----------------
+
+Configuring the Redis backend **requires the queue** or you won't see any gains (in fact you'll just negatively
+impact your performance).
+
+The first thing you will need to do is install two additional required packages:
+
+::
+
+    pip install redis nydus
+
+Finally, configure the buffer options:
+
+::
+
+    SENTRY_BUFFER = 'sentry.buffer.redis.RedisBuffer'
+    SENTRY_BUFFER_OPTIONS = {
+        'hosts': {
+            0: {
+                'host': 'localhost'
+                'port': 6379,
+            }
+        }
+    }
+
+Because the Redis buffer relies on the Nydus package, this gives you the ability to specify multiple nodes and
+have keys automatically distributed. It's unlikely that you'll need this functionality, but if you do, a simple
+configuration might look like this::
+
+    SENTRY_BUFFER_OPTIONS = {
+        'hosts': {
+            0: {
+                'host': '192.168.1.1'
+            }
+            1: {
+                'host': '192.168.1.2'
+            }
+        },
+    }
+
+With the default configuration this will distribute keys using a simple partition router (relatively even
+distribution).
