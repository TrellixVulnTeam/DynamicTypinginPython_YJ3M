+Conflicts with social_auth
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+A recent release of django-social-auth (0.7.18) added support for South migrations. This means that if you had an older
+version of the package installed, you'll need to "fake" the migrations, as they were already applied.
+
+**You should only do this is you actually receive an error while migrating.**

+To fake the migrations, run the following::

 Upgrading from 1.x
