    fix(issues) Don't index into null (#11635)
    
    Instead of using null for a default value using an Array gives us
    a consistent type that we can use elsewhere in the component more
    safely.
    
    Keep the type of `memberList` consistent, and forward null instead of an
    empty list to each selector as `null` has a specific meaning in that
    component.
    
    Fixes JAVASCRIPT-52T
