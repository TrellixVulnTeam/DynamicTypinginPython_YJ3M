+Contributing
+============
+
+Want to contribute back to Sentry? This page describes the general development flow,
+our philosophy, the test suite, and issue tracking.
+
+(Though it actually doesn't describe all of that, yet)
+
+Setting up an Environment
+-------------------------
+
+Sentry is designed to run off of setuptools with minimal work. Because of this
+setting up a development environment for Sentry requires only a few steps.
+
+The first thing you're going to want to do, is build a virtualenv and install
+any base dependancies.
+
+::
+
+    virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/sentry
+    source ~/.virtualenvs/sentry/bin/activate
+    python setup.py develop
+
+There are other optional dependancies, such as South, Haystack, and Eventlet, but
+they're not required to get a basic stack up and running.
+
+Running the Test Suite
+----------------------
+
+The test suite is also powered off of setuptools, and can be run in two fashions. The
+easiest is to simply use setuptools and it's ``test`` command. This will handle installing
+any dependancies you're missing automatically.
+
+::
+
+    python setup.py test
+
+If you've already installed the dependancies, or don't care about certain tests which will
+be skipped without them, you can also run tests in a more verbose way.
+
+::
+
+    python runtests.py
+
+The ``runtests.py`` command has several options, and if you're familiar w/ Django you should feel
+right at home.
+
+::
+
+    # Stop immediately on a failure
+    python runtests.py --failfast
+
+::
+    
+    # Run only SentryRemoteTest
+    python runtests.py sentry.SentryRemoteTest
+
+::
+    
+    # Run only the testTimestamp test on SentryRemoteTest
+    python runtests.py sentry.SentryRemoteTest.testTimestamp
