 Once you've brought up a worker, the next step is to enable the queue. This is
 done with a simple settings flag::
 
-    SENTRY_USE_QUEUE = True

+rely on the database, and move to something more efficient. These are documented in more
+details as part of the `Celery documentation <http://celeryproject.org/>`_, but something simple
