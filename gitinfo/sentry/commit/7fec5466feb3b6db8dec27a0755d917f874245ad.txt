+Command Line Usage
+==================
+
+Sentry installs a command line script under the name ``sentry``. This will
+allow you to perform most required operations that are unachievable within
+the web UI.
+
+If you're using a non-standard configuration location make sure you to pass the
+configuration via the ``SENTRY_CONF`` environment variable::
+
+    SENTRY_CONF=/etc/sentry sentry help
+
+For a list of commands, you can also use ``sentry help``, or ``sentry
+[command] --help`` for help on a specific command.
