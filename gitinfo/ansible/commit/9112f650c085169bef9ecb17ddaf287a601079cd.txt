 In order to keep the history clean and better audit incoming code, we will require resubmission of pull requests that contain merge commits.  Use "git pull --rebase" vs "git pull" and "git rebase" vs "git merge". Also be sure to use topic branches to keep your additions on different branches, such that they won't pick up stray commits later.
