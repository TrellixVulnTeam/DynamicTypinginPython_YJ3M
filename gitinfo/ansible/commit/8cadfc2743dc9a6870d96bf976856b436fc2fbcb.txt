+Module Repo Information
+=======================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
+
+On September 26, 2014, due to enormous levels of contribution to the project Ansible decided to reorganize module repos, making it easier
+for developers to work on the project and for us to more easily manage new contributions and tickets.
+
+We split modules from the main project off into two repos, http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core and http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+
+If you would still like this ticket attended to, we will need your help in having it reopened in one of the two new repos, and instructions are provided below.
+
+We apologize that we are not able to make this transition happen seamlessly, though this is a one-time change and your help is greatly appreciated -- 
+this will greatly improve velocity going forward.
+
+Both sets of modules will ship with Ansible, though they'll recieve slightly different ticket handling.
+
+To locate where a module lives between 'core' and 'extras'
+
+   * Find the module at http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_all_modules.html
+   * Open the documentation page for that module
+   * If the bottom of the docs say "This is an extras module", submit your ticket to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+   * Otherwise, submit your pull request to update the existing module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core
+   * action_plugins (modules with server side components) still live in the main repo.  If your ticket affects both, open the ticket
+     on the module repo just the same.
+
+Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:
+
+   * the ansible-project mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project
+
+Thanks you very much!

+
+We split modules from the main project off into two repos, http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core and http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+
+If you still would like this pull request merged, we will need your help making this target the new repo.  If you do not take any action, this
+pull request unfortunately cannot be applied.
+
+We apologize that we are not able to make this transition happen seamlessly, though this is a one-time change and your help is greatly appreciated -- 
+this will greatly improve velocity going forward.
+
+Both sets of modules will ship with Ansible, though they'll recieve slightly different ticket handling.

+
+   * Find the module at http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_all_modules.html
+   * Open the documentation page for that module
+   * If the bottom of the docs say "This is an extras module", submit your ticket to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+   * Otherwise, submit your pull request to update the existing module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core
+   * Note that python modules in ansible now also end in ".py" and this extension is required for new contributions.
+   * action_plugins (modules with server side components) still live in the main repo.  If your pull request touches both, which should be
+     exceedingly rare, submit two new pull requests and make sure to mention the links to each other in the comments.
+
+Otherwise, if this is a new module:
+
+   * Submit your pull request to add a module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+
+It may be possible to re-patriate your pull requests automatically, one user-submitted approach for advanced git users
+has been suggested at https://gist.github.com/willthames/afbaaab0c9681ed45619
+
+Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:

+
+Thanks you very much!
