-* Add a clone parameter to git module that allows you to get information about a remote repo even if it doesn't exist locally.
-
-* Safety changes: several modules have force parameters that defaulted to true.
-  These have been changed to default to false so as not to accidentally lose
-  work.  Playbooks that depended on the former behaviour simply need to add
-  force=True to the task that needs it.  Affected modules:
-
-  * bzr: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the bzr module used to
-    default to removing the modifications on any operation.  Now the module
-    will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is specified.
-    Operations that depend on a clean working tree may fail unless force=yes is
-    added.
-  * git: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the git module will now
-    fail unless force is explictly specified.  Specifying force=yes will allow
-    the module to revert and overwrite local modifications to make git actions
-    succeed.
-  * hg: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the hg module used to
-    default to removing the modifications on any operation.  Now the module
-    will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is specified.
-  * subversion: When updating a checkout with local modifications, you now need
-    to add force=yes so the module will revert the modifications before updating.
-
 * Optimize the plugin loader to cache available plugins much more efficiently.
   For some use cases this can lead to dramatic improvements in startup time.
