+Certain settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file.  The stock configuration should be sufficient
+for most users, but there may be reasons you would want to change them.
 
-The mechanism for doing this is the "ansible.cfg" file, which is looked for in the following locations::
+Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be processed processed in the following order::
 
+    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)
+    * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
+    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
     * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
-    * ~/.ansible.cfg
+
+Prior to 1.5 the order was::
+
     * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
+    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)
+    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
+    * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
 
-If multiple file locations matching the above exist, the last location on the above list is used.  Settings in files
-are not merged together.
+Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found. Settings in file are not merged together.
