+Ansible also provides a couple of variables for tasks in the ``rescue`` portion of a block:
+
+ansible_failed_task
+    The task that returned 'failed' and triggered the rescue. For example, to get the name use ``ansible_failed_task.name``.
+
+ansible_failed_result
+    The captured return result of the failed task that triggered the rescue. This would equate to having used this var in the ``register`` keyword.
