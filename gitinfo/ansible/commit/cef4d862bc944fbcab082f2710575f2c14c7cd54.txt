   * The :ref:`blockinfile module <blockinfile_module>` had its ``follow`` parameter removed because
     it inherently modifies the content of an existing file so it makes no sense to operate on the
     link itself.
+  * In Ansible-2.5.3, the :ref:`template module <template_module>` became more strict about its
+    ``src`` file being proper utf-8.  Previously, non-utf8 contents in a template module src file
+    would result in a mangled output file (the non-utf8 characters would be replaced with a unicode
+    replacement character).  Now, on Python2, the module will error out with the message, "Template
+    source files must be utf-8 encoded".  On Python3, the module will first attempt to pass the
+    non-utf8 characters through verbatim and fail if that does not succeed.
