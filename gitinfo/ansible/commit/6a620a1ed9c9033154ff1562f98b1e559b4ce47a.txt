+notes:
+  - When accessing the C(ansible_facts.services) facts collected by this module,
+    it is recommended to not use "dot notation" because services can have a C(-)
+    character in their name which would result in invalid "dot notation", such as
+    C(ansible_facts.services.zuul-gateway). It is instead recommended to
+    using the string value of the service name as the key in order to obtain
+    the fact data value like C(ansible_facts.services['zuul-gateway'])
