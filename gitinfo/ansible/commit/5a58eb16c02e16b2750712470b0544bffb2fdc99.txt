 <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to grok Chef these last weeks, and really, I don&#8217;t get it. I discovered ansible yesterday at noon, successfully ran it at 1pm, made my first playbook by 2pm, and pushed two small [contributions to the project] before the office closed... Do that with any other config management software!&#8221;</p>
 <p>&#8220;Ansible is much more firewall-friendly.  I have a number of hosts that are only accessible via reverse SSH tunnels, and let me tell you getting puppet or chef to play nice with that is a nightmare.&#8221;</p>
 <p>&#8220;This software has really changed my life as an network admin, the simplicity ansible comes with is really childs-play and I really adore its design. No more hassle with SSL keys, DNS based &#8216;server entries&#8217; (e.g. puppet and what not). Just plain (secure!) SSH keys and one is good to go.&#8221;</p>
+<p>&#8220;You may get a kick out of the fact that I'm using ansible to install puppetmaster(s).  I'm starting to migrate all my stuff to the much more sensical ansible. Nice work.&#8221;</p>
