    Pop password from os_user params
    
    The password param conflicts with os-client-config's password grabbing.
    The rest of the params really probably should also be popped - but
    keeping this just to password for now. Will follow up with a change that
    does an audit of all the os_ modules
    
    This patch was previously contributed by @emonty to the former
    ansible-modules-core repo however since the merge, it was closed
    and not completed.  This patch includes the necessary changes cleaned
    up to work with the latest release of Ansible.  This has been
    tested to work internally
