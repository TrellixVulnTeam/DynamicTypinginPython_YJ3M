-=============================================
+Ansible documentation
+=====================
 
-This project hosts the source behind [docs.ansible.com](https://docs.ansible.com/)
+This project hosts the source behind [docs.ansible.com](https://docs.ansible.com/).
 
-Contributions to the documentation are welcome. To make changes, submit a pull request that changes the reStructuredText files in the `rst/` directory only, and the core team can do a docs build and push the static files.
+To create clear, concise, consistent, useful materials on docs.ansible.com, please refer to the following information.
 
-If you wish to verify output from the markup such as link references, you may install sphinx and build the documentation by running `make webdocs` from the `ansible/docs/docsite` directory.
 
-To include module documentation you'll need to run `make webdocs` at the top level of the repository. The generated html files are in `docsite/htmlout/`.
+About Ansible
+-------------
+Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. Learn more about Ansible [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html).
 
-To limit module documentation building to a specific module, run `MODULES=NAME make webdocs` instead. This should make testing module documentation syntax much faster. Instead of a single module, you can also specify a comma-separated list of modules. In order to skip building documentation for all modules, specify non-existing module name, for example `MODULES=none make webdocs`.
+To install Ansible, see the [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
 
+The following sections provide information and resources on contributing to Ansible documentation.
+
+Contributions
+=============
+Ansible documentation is written in ReStructuredText(RST). Contributions to the documentation are welcome.
+
+The Ansible community produces guidance on contributions, building documentation, and submitting pull requests, which you can find in [Contributing to the Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/documentation_contributions.html).
+
+Filing issues
+-------------
 If you do not want to learn the reStructuredText format, you can also [file issues] about documentation problems on the Ansible GitHub project.
 
-Note that module documentation can actually be [generated from a DOCUMENTATION docstring][module-docs] in the modules directory, so corrections to modules written as such need to be made in the module source, rather than in docsite source.
+Editing docs directly on GitHub
+-------------------------------
+For typos and other quick fixes, you can edit the documentation right from the site. See [Editing docs directly on GitHub](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/documentation_contributions.html#editing-docs-directly-on-github) for more information.
+
+Ansible style guide
+===================
+
+To create clear, concise, consistent, useful materials on docs.ansible.com, follow the guidelines found in the [Ansible Style Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/style_guide/index.html#linguistic-guidelines).
+
+reStructuredText
+----------------
+The Ansible style guide also includes useful guidelines on writing in reStructuredText. Please see the style guide for reStructuredText formatting guidelines for:
+* header notation
+* internal navigation
+* linking
+* local table of contents
+
+
+Tools
+=====
+
+The Ansible community provides resources on tools used to write, test, and build documentation. In this section you will find some helpful links and workflow recommendations to get started writing or editing documentation.
+
+Popular editors
+---------------
+The Ansible community uses a range of tools for working with the Ansible project. Find a list of some of the most popular of these tools [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/other_tools_and_programs.html#popular-editors).
+
+Building documentation
+----------------------
+Building the documentation is the best way to check for errors and review your changes. Ansible documentation is built using Sphinx. For resources on Sphinx and building documentation, see [building the documentation locally](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/documentation_contributions.html#building-the-documentation-locally) in the Ansible Community Guide.
+
+Github
+------
+[Ansible documentation](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/docs/docsite) is hosted on the Ansible Github project.
+
+The following sections describe the workflows required to start developing or submit changes to Ansible documentation.
+
 
-To install sphinx and the required theme, install ``pip`` and then ``pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme``
+## Setting up Git

-[module-docs]: https://docs.ansible.com/developing_modules.html#documenting-your-module
 
-HEADERS
-=======
+GitHub provides a set of [Git cheatsheets](https://github.github.com/training-kit/) in multiple languages.
 
-RST allows for arbitrary hierarchy for the headers, it will 'learn on the fly'. We also want a standard that all our documents can follow:
+1. First [Install Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git)
 
+2. Perform the initial Git setup tasks, as described in [First Time Git Setup](link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).
+
+3. Navigate to https://github.com/ansible/ansible and [create a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo). This will create your own version of the repository which you can find at https://github.com/{yourusername}/ansible where {yourusername} is the username you created in GitHub.
+
+4. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) from your fork to create a copy on your local machine.
+
+  NOTE: It is possible to clone using SSH so you don't have to enter a username/password every time you push. Find instructions at [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) and [Which Remote URL Should I Use](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/). When using SSH, the origin lines will appear like this:
+`git@github.com:{yourusername}/ansible.git`
+
+
+```
+$ git clone  git@github.com:{yourusername}/ansible.git
 ```

+5. Navigate to the new directory by entering the following from the command line on your local machine:
+```
+$ cd {repository-name}
+```
 
-=, for sections
-===============
+6. Add a git remote to your local repository to link to the upstream version of the documentation. This makes it easier to update your fork and local version of the documentation.
+```
+$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
+```
 
--, for subsections
-------------------
+7. Check your settings.
+```
+$ git remote -v
+origin    https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_FORK}.git (fetch)
+origin    https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_FORK}.git (push)
+upstream  https://github.com/{ORIGINAL_OWNER}/{ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY}.git (fetch)
+upstream  https://github.com/{ORIGINAL_OWNER}/{ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY}.git (push)
+```
 
-^, for sub-subsections
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+## Creating a topic branch
 
-", for paragraphs
-"""""""""""""""""
+Create a topic branch for new documentation submissions or larger changes.
 
+1. Fetch updates from ``origin``:
+```
+$ git fetch origin
+```
+2. Checkout a new branch based on ``devel``:
 ```
+$ git checkout -b {branch name}
+```
+3. Create new documents or make changes to existing files.
+4. Add new or changed files:
+```
+$ git add {file name}
+```
+5. Commit your changes or additions. Be sure to include a commit message:
+```
+$ git commit -m "new message"
+```
+6. Push your updates back to `origin`:
+```
+$ git push -u origin {branch name}
+```
+
+Once you have completed this workflow, it is a good idea to build the documentation and ensure everything is correct and that it works. As a contributor, you are required to prove that See [building the documentation locally](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/documentation_contributions.html#building-the-documentation-locally) in the Ansible Community Guide for more on building documentation.
+
+
+When final additions or changes are pushed back to your fork you can open a pull request (PR).
+
+
+Working with pull requests (PRs)
+--------------------------------
+Pull requests represent the stage in a contribution where you are ready to submit your work for review and inclusion in the documentation. When a PR is opened, a reviewer will check the work and potentially open a dialog around your proposed changes. PRs should include specific information, which you can find in [Opening a new issue and/or PR](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/documentation_contributions.html#opening-a-new-issue-and-or-pr) in the Ansible Community Guide.
+
+## Creating a pull request
+1. Navigate to your personal fork: https://github.com/{yourusername}/ansible
+2. Click **Pull requests** and then click **New pull requests**.
+3. Use the drop-down menus, set the **base repository** to the stable branch and set the **head repository** to your topic branch.
+4. Apply appropriate labels. Include **backport** and **documentation**.
+6. Fill in the PR summary using the following template:
+
+```
+##### SUMMARY
+
+##### ISSUE TYPE
+
+##### COMPONENT NAME
+docs.ansible.com
+##### ANSIBLE VERSION
+
+##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
+
+```
+NOTE:
+If you put 'closes <issuenumber> '  in the summary, ansible will automatically close the issue on merge.
+
+7. Click **Create pull request**.
+
+
+A reviewer will evaluate your contribution. They may open a dialog around the PR and suggest revisions or, if the PR meets acceptance criteria, will merge it to the base branch.
+
+## Backporting a pull request
+
+All Ansible PRs must be merged to the `devel` branch first. Most users may, however, use a prior stable branch. Evaluate your pull request to determine if it applies to a prior branch.  
+
+See [Backporting merged PRs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/development_process.html?highlight=backport#backporting-merged-prs) for a complete worklfow.
+
+## Other Git workflows
 
-We do have pages littered with ```````` headers, but those should be removed for one of the above.
+In addition to creating a pull request and backporting, other workflows exist to help keep your topic branches and pull requests up-to-date. See the [Developer Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_rebasing.html) on `git rebase` to learn more about rebasing a pull request.
