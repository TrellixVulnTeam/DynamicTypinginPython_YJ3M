 short_description: Create security rule policy on PanOS devices.
-description: >
-    Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed.
-    The policy rules are compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and because the first rule that matches
-    the traffic is applied, the more specific rules must precede the more general ones.
