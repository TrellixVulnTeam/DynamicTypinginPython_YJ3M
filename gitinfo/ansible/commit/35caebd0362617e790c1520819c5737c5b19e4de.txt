    Fix ansible-test dependency processing.
    
    Previously, the following dependencies:
    
    A used by B
    B used by C
    
    Would have been converted to:
    
    A used by C
    B used by C
    
    Intead of being expanded to:
    
    A used by B
    A used by C
    B used by C
    
    This change preserves the existing dependency when expanding it.
