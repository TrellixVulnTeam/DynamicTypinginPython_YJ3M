 Ansible manages machines in an agent-less manner. There is never a question of how to
 upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled.  Because OpenSSH is one of the most peer-reviewed open source components, security exposure is greatly reduced. Ansible is decentralized--it relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines. If needed, Ansible can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized authentication management systems.

+In this example, we use the simple HAProxy load balancer to front-end the web servers. It's easy to configure and easy to manage. As we have mentioned, Ansible has built-in support for a variety of other load balancers like Citrix NetScaler, F5 BigIP, Amazon Elastic Load Balancers, and more. See the :ref:`working_with_modules` documentation for more information.
 
-For other load balancers, you may need to send shell commands to them (like we do for HAProxy above), or call an API, if your load balancer exposes one.

You can read more about local actions in the :doc:`playbooks_delegation` section.

-    Ansible 2.0 has deprecated the "ssh" from ``ansible_ssh_user``, ``ansible_ssh_host``, and ``ansible_ssh_port`` to become ``ansible_user``, ``ansible_host``, and ``ansible_port``. If you are using a version of Ansible prior to 2.0,  you should continue using the older style variables (``ansible_ssh_*``). These shorter variables are ignored, without warning, in older versions of Ansible.
