commit 7cd3d9cc1acdd76fedff9e98f8c86ce43742ad09
Author: Adam Miller <admiller@redhat.com>

    Correct msg to detect idempotent yum groupinstall (#37858)
    
    The message text used to check stderr for a warning about
    groupinstall in order to determine if a change occurred is specific
    to the version of yum that is in RHEL7 and newer. This change simply
    removes a couple words off the end in order to only use text found
    in the warning message in older versions of yum.
    
    Fixes #35982
