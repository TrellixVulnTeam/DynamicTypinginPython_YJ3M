 What is Cisco Meraki?
----------------------
+=====================
 
-Cisco Meraki is an easy to use, cloud based, network infrastructure platform for enterprise environments. While most network hardware uses command line interfaces (CLIs) for configuration, Meraki uses an easy to use Dashboard hosted in the Meraki cloud. No on-premises management hardware or software is required - only the network infrastructure to run your business.

 MS Switches
-...........
+-----------
 
 Meraki MS switches come in multiple flavors and form factors. Meraki switches support 10/100/1000/10000 ports, as well as Cisco's mGig technology for 2.5/5/10Gbps copper connectivity. 8, 24, and 48 port flavors are available with PoE (802.3af/802.3at/UPoE) available on many models.
 
 MX Firewalls
-............
+------------
 
 Meraki's MX firewalls support full layer 3-7 deep packet inspection. MX firewalls are compatible with a variety of VPN technologies including IPSec, SSL VPN, and Meraki's easy-to-use AutoVPN.
 
 MR Wireless Access Points
-.........................
+-------------------------
 
 MR access points are enterprise class, high performance, access points for the enterprise. MR access points have MIMO technology and integrated beamforming built-in for high performance applications. BLE allows for advanced location applications to be developed with no on-premises analytics platforms.
 
 Using the Meraki modules
-------------------------
+========================
 
 Meraki modules provide a user-friendly interface to manage your Meraki environment using Ansible. For example, details about SNMP settings for a particular organization can be discovered using the module `meraki_snmp <meraki_snmp_module>`.

 Common Parameters

 All Ansible Meraki modules support the following parameters which affect communication with the Meraki Dashboard API. Most of these should only be used by Meraki developers and not the general public.

 .. hint:: Use the ``org_id`` and ``net_id`` parameters when possible. ``org_name`` and ``net_name`` require additional behind-the-scenes API calls to learn the ID values. ``org_id`` and ``net_id`` will perform faster. 
 
 Meraki Authentication

 All API access with the Meraki Dashboard requires an API key. An API key can be generated from the organization's settings page. Each play in a playbook requires the ``api_key`` parameter to be specified.

 Returned Data Structures

 Meraki and its related Ansible modules return most information in the form of a list. For example, this is returned information by ``meraki_admin`` querying administrators. It returns a list even though there's only one.

 Handling Returned Data
-......................
+======================
 
 Since Meraki's response data uses lists instead of properly keyed dictionaries for responses, certain strategies should be used when querying data for particular information. For many situations, use the ``selectattr()`` Jinja2 function.
 
 Error Handling
-..............
+==============
 
 Ansible's Meraki modules will often fail if improper or incompatible parameters are specified. However, there will likely be scenarios where the module accepts the information but the Meraki API rejects the data. If this happens, the error will be returned in the ``body`` field for HTTP status of 400 return code.
