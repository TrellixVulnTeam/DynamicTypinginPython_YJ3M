+Some modules can be utilised in playbooks that target windows by delegating to localhost, depending on what you are
+attempting to achieve.  For example, assemble can be used to create a file on your ansible controller that is then 
+sent to your windows targets using win_copy.
 
 In many cases, it may not be necessary to even write or use an Ansible module.
