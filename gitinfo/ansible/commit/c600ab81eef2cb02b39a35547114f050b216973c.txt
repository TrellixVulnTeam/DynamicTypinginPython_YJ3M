+Non-SSH connection types
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+As stated in the previous section, Ansible is executing playbooks over SSH but is not limited to.
+With the host specific parameter ``ansible_connection=<connector>`` the connection type can be changed.
+Following non SSH based connectors are available:
+
+**local**
+
+This connector can be used to deploy the playbook to the control machine itself.
+
+**docker**
+
+This connector deploys the playbook directly into Docker containers using the local Docker client. Following parameters are processed by this connector:
+
+ansible_host
+    The name of the Docker container to connect to.
+ansible_user
+    The user name to operate within the container. The user must exist inside the container.
+ansible_become
+    If set to ``true`` the ``become_user`` will be used to operate within the container.
+ansible_docker_extra_args
+    Could be a string with any additional arguments understood by Docker, which are not command specific. This parameter is mainly used to configure a remote Docker daemon to use.
+
+Here an example of how to instantly depoloy to created containers::
+
+  - name: create jenkins container
+    docker:
+      name: my_jenkins
+      image: jenkins
+
