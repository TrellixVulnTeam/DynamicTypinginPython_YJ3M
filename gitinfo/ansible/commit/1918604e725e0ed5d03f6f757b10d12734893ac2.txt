 By passing ``--limit somegroup`` to ansible or ansible-playbook, the commands can be limited to a subset of hosts.  For instance, 
 this can be used to run a playbook that normally targets an entire set of servers to one particular server.
 
+Local Action
+++++++++++++
+
+A local_action directive in a playbook targeting remote machines means that the given step will actually occur on the local
+machine, but that the variable '{{ ansible_hostname }}' can be passed in to reference the remote hostname being referred to in
+that step.  This can be used to trigger, for example, an rsync operation.

 Local Connection

 By using "connection: local" in a playbook, or passing "-c local" to /usr/bin/ansible, this indicates that we are managing the local
 host and not a remote machine.
