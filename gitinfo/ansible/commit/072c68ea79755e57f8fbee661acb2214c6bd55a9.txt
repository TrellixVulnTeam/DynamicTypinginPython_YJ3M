     - The filter option filters only the first level subkey below ansible_facts.
+    - If the target host is Windows, you will not currently have the ability to use
+      C(filter) as this is provided by a simpler implementation of the module.
     - If the target host is Windows you can now use C(fact_path). Make sure that this path 
       exists on the target host. Files in this path MUST be PowerShell scripts (*.ps1) and 
       their output must be formattable in JSON (Ansible will take care of this). Test the 
       output of your scripts.
+      This option was added in Ansible 2.1.
