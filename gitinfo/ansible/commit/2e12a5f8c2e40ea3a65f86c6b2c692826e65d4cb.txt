    Revert "Removed a force conditional (#28851)" (#32282)
    
    This reverts commit 07acc579db839170122fc66505a886ef023d5f4f.
    
    On closer examination of this code, the conditional that had force in it
    was not a parent of this one.  So handling of force is needed i both
    branches.
    
    See the recent comments on #23391
