This requires different modules in some cases, so that you end up having one (1) expert module and several 'piecemeal' ones (ec2_vpc_net?). The reason for this is not, as many users express, because it allows a single task and keeps plays small (which just moves the data complexity into vars files, leaving you with a slightly different structure in another YAML file). It does, however, allow for a more 'atomic' operation against the underlying APIs and services.

These shorter variables are ignored, without warning, in older versions of Ansible. 
+    Ansible 2.0 has deprecated the "ssh" from ``ansible_ssh_user``, ``ansible_ssh_host``, and ``ansible_ssh_port`` to become ``ansible_user``, ``ansible_host``, and ``ansible_port``. If you are using a version of Ansible prior to 2.0,  you should continue using the older style variables (``ansible_ssh_*``). These shorter variables are ignored, without warning, in older versions of Ansible.
