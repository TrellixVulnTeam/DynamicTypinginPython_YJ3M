 * Added a new `meta` option: `end_play`, which can be used to skip to the end of a play.
 * roles can now be included in the middle of a task list via the new `include_role` module, this also allows for making the role import 'loopable' and/or conditional.
 * The service module has been changed to use system specific modules if they exist and fall back to the old service module if they cannot be found or detected.
+* Add ability to specify what ssh client binary to use on the controller.  This

 * removed previously deprecated ';' as host list separator.
