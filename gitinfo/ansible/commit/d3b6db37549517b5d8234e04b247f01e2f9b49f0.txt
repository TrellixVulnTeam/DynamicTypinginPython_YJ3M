+  - When network options are changed, the module disconnects all containers from the network, deletes the network, and re-creates the network.
+    It does not try to reconnect containers, except the ones listed in (I(connected), and even for these, it does not consider specific
+    connection options like fixed IP addresses or MAC addresses. If you need more control over how the containers are connected to the
+    network, loop the M(docker_container) module to loop over your containers to make sure they are connected properly.
+  - The module does not support Docker Swarm, i.e. it will not try to disconnect or reconnect services. If services are connected to the
+    network, deleting the network will fail. When network options are changed, the network has to be deleted and recreated, so this will
+    fail as well.
