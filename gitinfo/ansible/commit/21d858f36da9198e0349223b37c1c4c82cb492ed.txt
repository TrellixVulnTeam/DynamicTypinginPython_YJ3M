+Language constructs like "with_fileglob" and "with_items" are implemented via lookup plugins.  Just like other plugin types, you can write your own.

+Vars Plugins
+------------
+
+Playbook constructs like 'host_vars' and 'group_vars' work via 'vars' plugins.  They inject additional variable
+data into ansible runs that did not come from an inventory, playbook, or command line.  Note that variables
+can also be returned from inventory, so in most cases, you won't need to write or understand vars_plugins.
+
+Filter Plugins
+--------------
+
+If you want more Jinja2 filters available in a Jinja2 template (filters like to_yaml and to_json are provided by default), they can be extended by writing a filter plugin.
