+  - The C(ssh) connection plugin will force pseudo-tty allocation via C(-tt) when scripts are executed. Pseudo-ttys do not have a stderr channel and all
     stderr is sent to stdout. If you depend on separated stdout and stderr result keys, please switch to a copy+command set of tasks instead of using script.

   - If the path to the local script contains spaces, it needs to be quoted.
