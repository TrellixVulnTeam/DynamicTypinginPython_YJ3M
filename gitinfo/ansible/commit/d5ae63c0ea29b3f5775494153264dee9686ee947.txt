    Change wording of Going Further section (#35949)
    
    * Change wording of Going Further section
    
    The original wording was confusing with its non-devel branch part.
    Made it much clearer for people to understand what to do.
    
    Also removed the git command for creating branches, I believe a
    develop should be aware of how basic git commands work.
    
    * Edited for concision and clarity.
    
    * Typo fix

 Going Further
 =============
 
-If you are starting new development or fixing a bug, create a new branch:
-
-``$ git checkout -b my-new-branch``.
-
-If you are planning on contributing
-back to the main Ansible repository, fork the Ansible repository into
-your own GitHub account and develop against the new non-devel branch
-in your fork. When you believe you have a good working code change,
-submit a pull request to the Ansible repository.
+If you would like to contribute to the main Ansible repository
+by adding a new feature or fixing a bug, `create a fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_
+of the Ansible repository and develop against a new feature
+branch using the ``devel`` branch as a starting point.
+
+When you you have a good working code change,
+submit a pull request to the Ansible repository by selecting
+your feature branch as a source and the Ansible devel branch as
+a target.
 
 If you want to submit a new module to the upstream Ansible repo, be sure
 to run through sanity checks first. For example:
