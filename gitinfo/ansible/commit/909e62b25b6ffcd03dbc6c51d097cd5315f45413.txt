 notes:
     - THIS IS EARLY PREVIEW, THINGS MAY CHANGE
-    - Only basic roles have been tested for now, some things might not work as expected.
     - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
-    - Currently role variables are not pushed up to the play.
     - simple dependencies seem to work fine.
-    - Role search paths work (implicit vars/ templates/ files/ etc)
-    - loops don't work.
     - "Things not tested (yet): plugin overrides, nesting includes, used as handler, other stuff I did not think of when I wrote this."
