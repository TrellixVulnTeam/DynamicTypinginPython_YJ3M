 Example 2: simplifying playbooks with network agnostic modules
 ==============================================================

 If you have two or more network platforms in your environment, you can use the network agnostic modules to simplify your playbooks. You can use network agnostic modules such as ``cli_command`` or ``cli_config`` in place of the platform-specific modules such as ``eos_config``, ``ios_config``, and ``junos_config``. This reduces the number of tasks and conditionals you need in your playbooks.
