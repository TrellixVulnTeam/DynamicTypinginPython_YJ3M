 You can link from your module documentation to other module docs, other resources on docs.ansible.com, and resources elsewhere on the internet. The correct formats for these links are:
 
-* ``L()`` for Links with a heading. For example: ``See L(IOS Platform Options guide,../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).``
+* ``L()`` for links with a heading. For example: ``See L(Ansible Tower,https://www.ansible.com/products/tower).`` As of Ansible 2.10, do not use ``L()`` for relative links between Ansible documentation and collection documentation.
 * ``U()`` for URLs. For example: ``See U(https://www.ansible.com/products/tower) for an overview.``
+* ``R()`` for cross-references with a heading (added in Ansible 2.10). For example: ``See R(Cisco IOS Platform Guide,ios_platform_options)``.  Use the RST anchor for the cross-reference. See :ref:`adding_anchors_rst` for details.
 * ``I()`` for option names. For example: ``Required if I(state=present).``
 * ``C()`` for files and option values. For example: ``If not set the environment variable C(ACME_PASSWORD) will be used.``
 * ``M()`` for module names. For example: ``See also M(win_copy) or M(win_template).``
 
 .. note::
 
-  For modules in a collection, you can only use ``L()`` and ``M()`` for content within that collection. Use ``U()`` to refer to content in a different collection.
+  For links between modules and documentation within a collection, you can use any of the options above. For links outside of your collection, use ``R()`` if available. Otherwise, use ``U()`` or ``L()`` with full URLs (not relative links). If you are creating your own documentation site, you will need to use the `intersphinx extension <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html>`_ to convert ``R()`` and ``M()`` to the correct links.
