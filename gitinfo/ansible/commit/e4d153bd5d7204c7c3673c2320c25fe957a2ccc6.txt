 This requires a reboot.

+Once WSL is enabled, you can open the Bash terminal. At the prompt, you can quickly start using the latest Ansible release by running the following commands::
 
-    sudo apt-get install python-pip
-    pip install pywinrm
-    git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
-    source ansible/hacking/env-setup
+    sudo apt-get update
+    sudo apt-get install python-pip git libffi-dev libssl-dev -y
+    pip install ansible pywinrm

+    # this step is only necessary for Windows builds earlier than 16188, and must be repeated each time bash is launched,
+    # unless bash is launched as ``bash --login``
+    # see https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/2148 and

 After you've successfully run these commands, you can start to create your inventory, write example playbooks and start targeting systems using the plethora of available Windows modules.
 
-.. Note:: Ansible is also reported to work on Cygwin, but this is more cumbersome and doesn't scale as well as WSL.
+If you want to run Ansible from source for development purposes, simply uninstall the pip-installed version (which will leave all the necessary dependencies behind), then clone the Ansible source, and run the hacking script to configure it to run from source::
+
+    pip uninstall ansible -y
+    git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
+    source ansible/hacking/env-setup
+
+.. Note:: Ansible is also reported to "work" on Cygwin, but installation is more cumbersome, and will incur sporadic failures due to Cygwin's implementation of ``fork()``.
