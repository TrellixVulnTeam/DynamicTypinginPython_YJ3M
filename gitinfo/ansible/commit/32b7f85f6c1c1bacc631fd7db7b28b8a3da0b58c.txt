 short_description: Configure timezone setting
 description:
-  - This module configures the timezone setting, both of the system clock
-    and of the hardware clock. I(Currently only Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
-    OpenBSD and SmartOS instances are supported.)
-    It is recommended to restart C(crond) after changing the timezone,
-    otherwise the jobs may run at the wrong time.
-    On Linux it uses the C(timedatectl) command if available. Otherwise,
-    it edits C(/etc/sysconfig/clock) or C(/etc/timezone) for the system clock,
-    and uses the C(hwclock) command for the hardware clock.
-    On SmartOS the C(sm-set-timezone) utility is used to set the zone timezone,
-    and on *BSD, C(/etc/localtime) is modified.
-    If you want to set up the NTP, use M(service) module.
