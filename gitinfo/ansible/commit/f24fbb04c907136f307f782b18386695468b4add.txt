    Ansible 2.0 has depricated the “ssh” from ansible_ssh_user,
    ansible_ssh_host, and ansible_ssh_port to become ansible_user,
    ansible_host, and ansible_port. If you are using a version of
    Ansible prior to 2.0, you should continue using the older style
    variables (ansible_ssh_*). These shorter variables are ignored,
    without warning, in older versions of Ansible.
