+    # think about what other kinds of variables you would like to use in ansible.  It's easy to write lookup
+    # plugins and the name of the plugin will make "with_(PLUGIN)" available for use in the task syntax.
+    # for instance, writing a plugin named "weather" would make "with_weather" available, and you could
+    # write a lookup plugin to query the weather forecast.
+
+    # note with_items and with_* are currently incompatible, and you can use only one of these per task.
