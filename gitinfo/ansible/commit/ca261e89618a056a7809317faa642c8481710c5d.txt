+There is a matching 'is_unset' that works the same way.  Do not quote the variables inside the function.

+While only_if is a pretty good option for advanced users, it exposes more guts of the engine than we'd like, and

+Various 'lookup plugins' allow additional ways to iterate over data.  Ansible will have more of these
