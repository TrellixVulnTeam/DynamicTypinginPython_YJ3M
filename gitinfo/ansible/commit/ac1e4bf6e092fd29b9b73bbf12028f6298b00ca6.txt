    Update the documentation of the 'apt' action for the 'name'.

Note that the apt-get commandline supports implicit regex matches here but we do not because it can let typos through easier (If you typo C(foo) as C(fo) apt-get would install packages that have "fo" in their name with a warning and a prompt for the user.  Since we don't have warnings and prompts before installing we disallow this.  Use an explicit fnmatch pattern if you want wildcarding)
