    jenkins_plugin: doc: Specify version as string (#18858)
    
    If the plugin version expected is, say '1.20', then specifying it
    as...
        version: 1.20
    ... will make the YAML parser interpret it as a float, and the
    value obtained by the module will be 1.2 instead of 1.20, which
    will cause downloading of wrong version of the module.
    
    This patch updates the docs so that users don't face this issue.
