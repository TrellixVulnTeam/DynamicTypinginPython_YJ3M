    copy module "dest" parameter is not only absolute (#50974)
    
    We should explain the danger of using relative paths, but we should not
    say they aren't allowed. Relative paths work and are useful, but the
    caveat is that the starting point can't be guaranteed by ansible. This
    commit adds that note, and removes the claim that only absolute paths
    are accepted.
