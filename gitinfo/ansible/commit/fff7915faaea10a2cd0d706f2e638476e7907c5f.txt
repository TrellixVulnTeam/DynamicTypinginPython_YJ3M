    [aws][doc] Update documentation for wait_timeout option (#39875)
    
    Based on the documentation, 'wait_timeout' is 'Used in conjunction with instance_ids option'.  This lead me to believe that I could not use this parameter to try and solve the 'Waited too long for ELB instances to be healthy' error I was experiencing.
