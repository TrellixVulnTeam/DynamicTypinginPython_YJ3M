    Emphasize target is on remote host. List supported file types.
    
    From the documentation it is not immediately clear that the 'target'
    option refers to a location on the remote host. This change emphasizes that.
    In addition to .sql files, .bz2 and .gz files are supported for dumps and
    restores. This is now documented.
