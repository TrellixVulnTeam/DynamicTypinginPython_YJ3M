 Security Group
-  Instances belong to one or more security groups. A group is created for each security group, with all characters except alphanumerics, converted to underscores (_). Each group is prefixed by ``security_group_``. Currently, dashes (-) are also converted to underscores (_), you can change using the `replace_dash_in_groups` setting in ec2.ini (this has changed across several versions so check the ec2.ini for details).
