+Quickstart Video
+````````````````
+
+We've recorded a short video that shows how to get started with Ansible that you may like to use alongside the documentation.
+
+The `quickstart video <http://ansibleworks.com/quickstart/>`_ is about 20 minutes long and will show you some of the basics about your
+first steps with Ansible.
