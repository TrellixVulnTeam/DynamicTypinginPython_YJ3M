 As with most Ansible modules, the default states of the Packet modules are idempotent, meaning the resources in your project will remain the same after re-runs of a playbook. Thus, we can keep the ``packet_sshkey`` module call in our playbook. If the public key is already in your Packet account, the call will have no effect.
