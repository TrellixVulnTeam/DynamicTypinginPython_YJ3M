+todo:
+    - detect changed/unchanged for .zip files
+    - handle common unarchive args, like preserve owner/timestamp etc...
 notes:
-    - requires tar command on host
-    - can handle gzip, bzip2 and xz compressed as well as uncompressed
+    - requires tar/unzip command on host
+    - can handle gzip, bzip2 and xz compressed as well as uncompressed tar files
+    - detects type of archive automatically
     - uses tar's --diff arg to calculate if changed or not.  If this arg is not
       supported, it will always unpack the archive
+    - does not detect if a .zip file is different from destination - always unzips
     - existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archvie
       are not touched.  This is the same behavior as a normal archive extraction
     - existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archvie
