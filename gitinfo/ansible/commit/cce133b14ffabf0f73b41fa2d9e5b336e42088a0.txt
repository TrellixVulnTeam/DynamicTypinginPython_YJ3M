    WinRM: Add operation and read timeout variables to docs (#24922)
    
    * Add operation and read timeout variables to docs
    
    Since WinRM is not the most reliable protocol, it may be necessary to increase its timeout values to get a better experience.
    
    * Update intro_windows.rst
    
    Great idea to add this.
    I changed 'experienced' -> 'experience' (present continuous rather than past tense).  Added some . to be consistent with other lines.

 * ``ansible_winrm_path``: Specify an alternate path to the WinRM endpoint.  Ansible uses ``/wsman`` by default.
 * ``ansible_winrm_realm``: Specify the realm to use for Kerberos authentication.  If the username contains ``@``, Ansible will use the part of the username after ``@`` by default.
 * ``ansible_winrm_transport``: Specify one or more transports as a comma-separated list.  By default, Ansible will use ``kerberos,plaintext`` if the ``kerberos`` module is installed and a realm is defined, otherwise ``plaintext``.
-* ``ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation``: Specify the server certificate validation mode (``ignore`` or ``validate``). Ansible defaults to ``validate`` on Python 2.7.9 and higher, which will result in certificate validation errors against the Windows self-signed certificates. Unless verifiable certificates have been configured on the WinRM listeners, this should be set to ``ignore``
