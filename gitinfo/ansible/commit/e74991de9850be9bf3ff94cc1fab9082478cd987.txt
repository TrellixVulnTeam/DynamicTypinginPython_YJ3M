 Tower allows you to control access to who can access what, even allowing sharing of SSH credentials without someone being able to transfer those credentials.  Inventory can be graphically managed or synced with a wide variety of cloud sources.  It logs all of your jobs, integrates well with LDAP, and has an amazing browsable REST API.
