    Fix docs re inventory_ignore_extensions config (#21132)
    
    The list of ignored by default extensions is outdated in doc for dynamic
    inventories, and this option is completely missing from configuration
    file overview.

 In an inventory directory, executable files will be treated as dynamic inventory sources and most other files as static sources. Files which end with any of the following will be ignored::
 
-    ~, .orig, .bak, .ini, .retry, .pyc, .pyo
+    ~, .orig, .bak, .ini, .cfg, .retry, .pyc, .pyo
 
 You can replace this list with your own selection by configuring an ``inventory_ignore_extensions`` list in ansible.cfg, or setting the ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_IGNORE environment variable. The value in either case should be a comma-separated list of patterns, as shown above.
