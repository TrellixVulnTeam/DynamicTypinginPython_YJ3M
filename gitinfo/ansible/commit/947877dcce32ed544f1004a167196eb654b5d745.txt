    Try to avoid module-related tickets in the core Ansible project (#17047)
    
    * Try to avoid module-related tickets in the core Ansible project
    
    Since most users still report module-related problems in the Ansible core GitHub project, I added a warning at the top of the template.
    
    Maybe it could help if the various projects would have more specific names ?
    
     - ansible/ansible  ->  ansible/main (or something even better ?)
     - ansible/ansible-modules-core  ->  ansible/modules-core
     - ansible/ansible-modules-extras  ->  ansible/modules-extras
    
    I am sure someone can come up with perfect names ;-)
    
    * Remove 'module' from the component options
    
    I would prefer to again note that modules should go elsewhere, but don't want to bloat the text too much.
