 short_description: Invokes a PowerShell DSC configuration
-description: |
-     Invokes a PowerShell DSC Configuration. Requires PowerShell version 5 (February release or newer).
-     Most of the parameters for this module are dynamic and will vary depending on the DSC Resource.
-     In order to find the required parameters for a given DSC resource, you can use the following on-liner:
-     'Get-DscResource <dsc_resource> | select -ExpandProperty properties'
-     Also note that credentials are handled as follows: If the resource accepts a credential type property called "cred",
-     the ansible parameters would be cred_username and cred_password.
-     These will be used to inject a credential object on the fly for the DSC resource.
