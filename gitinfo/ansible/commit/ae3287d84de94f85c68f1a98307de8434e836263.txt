+Internal Ansible API
+====================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us
+to have an active community that is willing to submit feedback so that we may
+continue to make Ansible better.
+
+The internal Python API is considered an unsupported aspect of Ansible and this
+is not considered a bug unless there is an issue with an Ansible binary
+(`ansible`, `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-doc`, etc) or an issue with an external
+API such as are provided for the development of plugins (modules, dynamic
+inventories, callbacks, strategies, etc).
+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
