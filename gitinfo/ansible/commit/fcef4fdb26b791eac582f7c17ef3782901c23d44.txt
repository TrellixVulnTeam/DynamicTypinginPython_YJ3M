    ec2_asg: adding explanation of replace_all_instances (#46694)
    
    * adding explanation of replace_all_instances
    
    How does "replace_all_instances" work? does it increase the number of instances by 1 in the Load balancer and it scales in a server and waits for it to complete its health check, OR   does it terminate a node a that causes an autoscale event to happen and then adds a new server?
