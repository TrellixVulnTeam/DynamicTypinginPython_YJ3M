An exception to this is made in cases where integration tests are logistically not feasible due to external requirements.  An example of this is AWS Direct Connect, as this service can not be functionally tested without the establishment of network peering connections.  Unit tests are therefore required for modules that interact with AWS Direct Connect.  Exceptions to ``amazon.aws`` must be approved by Red Hat, and exceptions to ``community.aws`` must be approved by the AWS community.
