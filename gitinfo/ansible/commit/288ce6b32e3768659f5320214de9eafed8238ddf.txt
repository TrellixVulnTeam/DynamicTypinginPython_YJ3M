 While Func, which I co-wrote, aspired to avoid using SSH and have it's own daemon infrastructure, Ansible aspires to be quite different and more minimal, but still able to grow more modularly over time. 
 
+Why use Ansible versus something else?  (Fabric, Capistrano, mCollective, Func, SaltStack, etc?) It will have far less code, it will be more correct, and it will be the easiest thing to hack on and use you'll ever see -- regardless of your favorite language of choice.

 Principles
 ==========
 
     * Dead simple setup
+    * Super fast & parallel by default
     * No server or client daemons, uses existing SSHd
+    * No additional software required on client boxes
+    * Everything is self updating on the clients.  "Modules" are remotely transferred to target boxes and exec'd, and do not stay active or consume resources.
     * Only SSH keys are allowed for authentication
-    * usage of ssh-agent is more or less required
+    * usage of ssh-agent is more or less required (no passwords)
     * plugins can be written in ANY language
     * as with Func, API usage is an equal citizen to CLI usage
     * use Python's multiprocessing capabilities to emulate Func's forkbomb logic
+    * all file paths can be specified as command line options easily allowing non-root usage
 
 Requirements
 ============
 
 For the server the tool is running from, *only*:
 
-    * python 2.6 -- or a backport of the multiprocessing module
+    * python 2.6 -- or the 2.4/2.5 backport of the multiprocessing module
     * paramiko
 
 Inventory file
 ==============
 
+The inventory file is a required list of hostnames that can be potentially managed by
+ansible.  Eventually this file may be editable via the CLI, but for now, is
+edited with your favorite text editor.
+
 The default inventory file (-H) is ~/.ansible_hosts and is a list
 of all hostnames to target with ansible, one per line.  These
 can be hostnames or IPs

 Future plans
 ============

-     a runbook style recipe file
+   * modules including:
+       * users, groups, files, permissions, etc
+       * inventory gathering (w/ accompanying ansible-inventory & RSS)

+   * Dead-simple declarative configuration management engine using
+     a runbook style recipe file, written in JSON or YAML
    * facts engine, including exec'ing facter if present
