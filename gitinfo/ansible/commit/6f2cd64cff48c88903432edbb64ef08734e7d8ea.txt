    Include .git_keep files in role template skeleton (#24381)
    
    setup.py will not install package_data this is just an empty
    directory, even if the globs in package_data match it.
    
    So the role skeleton that was being installed to galaxy/data/*/
    was excluding the files/ and templates/ directories since they were
    empty.
    
    Since the skeleton dir doesnt include those dirs
    'ansible-galaxy init' would not set them up.
    
    So this adds a .* glob to those directories so the .git_keep
    will be included as well, so that setup.py will create the otherwise
    empty directoty. ansible-galaxy init already knows to ignore those
    files, so no other changes are needed.
    
    (Including the .git_keep files is a little odd, but the alternative
    would be creating our own placeholder files. Since ansible-galaxy
    already understands .git_keep files we just reuse that)
    
    Fixes #23597
