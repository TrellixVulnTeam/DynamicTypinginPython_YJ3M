+What Will Be Installed
+``````````````````````
 
-Requirements for Ansible are extremely minimal.
+Ansible by default manages machines over the SSH protocol.
 
-For the central Ansible machine, you will need an environment with Python 2.6 or greater installed. If you are running Python 2.5 on an "Enterprise Linux 5" variant, we'll show you how to add 2.6 to your distribution, but most platforms already have a new enough Python. (Note that Windows is not supported as the Ansible control machine.)
+Once ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running.  You only need to install it on one machine (which could easily be a laptop) and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point.  When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, so there's no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version.
 
-You will also want the following Python modules (installed via pip or perhaps via your OS package manager via slightly different names):
+What Version To Pick?
+`````````````````````
 
-* ``paramiko``
-* ``PyYAML``
-* ``jinja2``
+Because it runs so easily from source and does not require any installation of software on remote
+machines, many users will actually track the development version.  
 
-If you are using RHEL or CentOS 5, Python is version 2.4 by default, but you can get Python 2.6 installed easily. `Use EPEL <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ and install these dependencies as follows:
+If you are wishing to run the latest released version of Ansible and you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (TM), CentOS, Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu, we recommend using our OS package manager.
 
-.. code-block:: bash
+For other installation options, we recommend installing via "pip", which is the Python package manager, though other options are also available.

+If you wish to track the development release to use and test the latest features, we will share
+information about running from source.  It's not neccessary to install the program to run from source.

-   $ yum install python26 python26-PyYAML python26-paramiko python26-jinja2
+Currently Ansible can be from any machine with Python 2.6 installed (Windows isn't supported for the control machine).

+to use it and there is no software to actually install for Ansible itself.  No daemons
+or database setup are required.  Because of this, many users in our community use the
+development version of Ansible all of the time, so they can take advantage of new features
+when they are implemented, and also easily contribute to the project. Because there is
+nothing to install, following the development version is significantly easier than most
