    Fail hard when tests pass that are expected to fail
    
    `@pytest.mark.xfail()` can be used to decorate tests that don't yet
    pass. By default, if I wrote a test like this:
    
    ```
    @pytest.mark.xfail()
    def test_naughty():
        assert 1 == 1
    ```
    
    Then Pytest would allow this test to pass without notifying that an
    expected-fail *didn't* fail. To make that happen, you have to set
    xfail_strict=True so that the above test would cause the tests to fail.
