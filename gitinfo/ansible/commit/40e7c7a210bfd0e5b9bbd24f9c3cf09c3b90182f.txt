    Add a porting guide entry for ansible_distribution facts (#50251)
    
    * Add a porting guide entry for ansible_distribution facts
    
    Switching away from platform.distro() will cause changes sometimes due
    to the new code using new sources of information that may be out of sync
    with the old ones.  Just have to make people aware of that and also what
    we are doing to mitigate it when appropriate.
    
    * wordsmithed, added links for new distro backend

+Distribution Facts
+------------------
+
+The information returned for the ``ansible_distribution_*`` group of facts may have changed
+slightly.  Ansible 2.8 uses a new backend library for information about distributions: `nir0s/distro <https://github.com/nir0s/distro>`_. This library runs on Python-3.8 and fixes many bugs, including correcting release and version names.
+
+The two facts used in playbooks most often, ``ansible_distribution`` and ``ansible_distribution_major_version``, should not change. If you discover a change in these facts, please file a bug so we can address the
+difference.  However, other facts like ``ansible_distribution_release`` and
+``ansible_distribution_version`` may change as erroneous information gets corrected.
