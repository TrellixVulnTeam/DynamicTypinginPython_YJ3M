-You can set these parameters on each host.
+As a summary, you can set these parameters as host inventory variables.  (Some we have already
+mentioned).
 
 ansible_ssh_host
-  Actual hostname
+  The name of the host to connect to, if different from the alias you wish to give to it.
 ansible_ssh_port
-  ssh port number
+  The ssh port number, if not 22
 ansible_ssh_user
-  ssh user name
+  The default ssh user name to use.
 ansible_ssh_pass
-  ssh password
+  The ssh password to use (this is insecure, we strongly recommend using --ask-pass or SSH keys)

 ansible_syslog_facility
-  Define syslog facility
+  The syslog facility to log to.
 ansible_python_interpreter
-  Define a target host python path. This is userful for systems with more

 ansible\_\*\_interpreter
