+# starting from today. So you would specify -CertValidityDays 3650 to get
+# a 10-year valid certificate.
 #
 # Use option -ForceNewSSLCert if the system has been SysPreped and a new
 # SSL Certifcate must be forced on the WinRM Listener when re-running this
 # script. This is necessary when a new SID and CN name is created.
