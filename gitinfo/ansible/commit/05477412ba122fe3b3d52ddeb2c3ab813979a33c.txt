commit 05477412ba122fe3b3d52ddeb2c3ab813979a33c

    Enforce the _raw_params variable with include_role (#26430)
    
    Currently, when using this test, it fails with the following error
    message:
    
    > AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rfind'
    
    This is because there is no _raw_params value for parent_include.args
    here
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/playbook/included_file.py#L104
    
    This commit ensure the value is specified so it can be reused and hence
    not fail at this specific line.
