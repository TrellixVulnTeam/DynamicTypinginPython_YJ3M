    Adjust documentation for yum clean to use best practices (#62898)
    
    The yum module docs suggested using `shell: yum clean all`, which gives an `ansible-lint` error. Plus, you should use the `command` module unless you need more advanced features than just passing in an arbitrary command. Fixes that problem by using the `command` module in the example instead.
