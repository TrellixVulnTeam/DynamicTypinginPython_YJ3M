+# Docker_Volume Modules Proposal
+
+## Purpose and Scope
+
+The purpose of docker_volume is to manage volumes.
+ 
+Docker_volume will manage volumes using docker-py to communicate with either a local or remote API. It will
+support API versions >= 1.14. API connection details will be handled externally in a shared utility module similar 
+to how other cloud modules operate.
+ 
+## Parameters
+
+Docker_volume accepts the parameters listed below. Parameters for connecting to the API are not listed here, as they
+will be part of the shared module mentioned above.
+
+```
+driver:
+  description:
+    - Volume driver.
+  default: local
+  
+force:
+  description:
+    - Use with state 'present' to force removal and re-creation of an existing volume. This will not remove and
+      re-create the volume if it is already in use.
+
+name:
+  description:
+    - Name of the volume.
+  required: true
+  default: null
+
+options:
+  description:
+    - Dictionary of driver specific options. The local driver does not currently support
+      any options.
+  default: null
+
+state:
+  description:
+    - "absent" removes a volume. A volume cannot be removed if it is in use.
+    - "present" create a volume with the specified name, if the volume does not already exist. Use the force
+      option to remove and re-create a volume. Even with the force option a volume cannot be removed and re-created if
+      it is in use.
+  default: present
+  choices:
+    - absent
+    - present  
+```
+
+## Examples
+
+```
+- name: Create a volume
+  docker_volume:
+    name: data
+
+- name: Remove a volume
+  docker_volume:
+    name: data
+    state: absent
+
+- name: Re-create an existing volume
+  docker_volume:
+    name: data
+    state: present
+    force: yes
+```
+
+## Returns
+
+```
+{
+    changed: true,
+    failed: false,
+    rc: 0,
+    action: removed | created | none
+    results: {
+        < show the result of docker inspect of an affected volume >
+    }
+}
+```
