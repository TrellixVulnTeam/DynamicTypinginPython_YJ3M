    debian: install lib in dist-packages (#64412)
    
    On Ubuntu Precise and Trusty, the build was failing because the Ansible
    libs were installed in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
    
    According to the Debian Policy (2.5), they should actually be install in
    /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages This is also CDBS default behaviour since
    0.4.131.
    
    See: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/ch-python.html
    
    Closes: #64160
