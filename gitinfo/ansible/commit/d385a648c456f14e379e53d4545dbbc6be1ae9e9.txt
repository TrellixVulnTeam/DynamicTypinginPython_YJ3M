    uri: Document cookies_string, cookies and content (#66612)
    
    The example with set_cookie value in cookie header can fail if the server
    has set many cookies. The set_cookie value is the cookies sent by server in
    set-cookie header, not what the client should send in cookie header to
    server.
    
    #33792 introduced cookies_string to solve the problem, but did not update
    the uri module example.
    
    content and cookies were also missing from RETURN.
