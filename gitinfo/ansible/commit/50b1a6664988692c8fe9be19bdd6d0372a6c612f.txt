 #. Take note of the directory Ansible used to store modules on the remote host. This directory is usually under the home directory of your ``ansible_user``, in the form ``~/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-...``.
 #. SSH into the remote target after the playbook runs.
 #. Navigate to the directory you noted in step 3.
-#. Extract the module you want to debug from the zipped file that Ansible sent to the remote host: ``$ python my_test_module.py explode``. Ansible will expand the module into ``./debug-dir``. You can optionally run the zipped file by specifying ``python my_test_module.py``.
