 =============
 This document is now the location for published Ansible Core roadmaps.     
 
-The roadmap will be updated by version. Based on team and community feedback an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (2.0, 2.1)  Subminor versions will generally not have roadmaps published.

-This is the first time we've published this and asked for feedback in exactly this manner.  So feedback on the roadmap and the new process is quite welcome.  We're aiming for further transparency and better inclusion of both community desires and submissions.

-These are our *best guess* roadmaps based on our own experience and based on requests and feedback from the community.  There are things that may not make it on due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc.  And there may be things we missed, so each roadmap is both published as an idea of what's upcoming in Ansible, but also as a medium for seeking further feedback from the community.
