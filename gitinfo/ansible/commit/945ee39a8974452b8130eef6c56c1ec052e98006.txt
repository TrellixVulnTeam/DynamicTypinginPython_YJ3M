commit 945ee39a8974452b8130eef6c56c1ec052e98006
Author: Will Thames <will@thames.id.au>
Date:   Wed Feb 6 22:34:18 2019 +1000

    Improve the issue template for dependency problems (#51657)
    
    So many reports of missing modules could be solved
    more quickly with the info from `python_requirements_facts`
    
    Replace the legacy issue template with a link to the
    new interface
