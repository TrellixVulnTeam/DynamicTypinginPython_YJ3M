commit 3b008d6fa6f8d29262b846276cd68a1c4621d94b

    Expand usage synopsis
    
    'source' is actually a "bashism" and the POSIX-way of sourcing a file
    uses the single dot (which is arguably less readable). Both yield the
    same result, and since the script may now also be sourced from
    within the hacking directory, this commit expands the usage synopsis
    accordingly.
