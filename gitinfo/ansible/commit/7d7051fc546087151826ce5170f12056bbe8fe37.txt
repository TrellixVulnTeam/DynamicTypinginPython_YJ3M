    Mutually reference Windows and non-Windows modules (#25482)
    
    * Mutually reference Windows and non-Windows modules
    
    To make it easier for Windows or non-Windows users to find the relevant
    module information, we are mutually referencing both variants in their
    documentation.
    
    We are also adding a special note if a module works on both Windows and
    non-Windows targets.

 - For extracting any compression types other than .zip, the PowerShellCommunityExtensions (PSCX) Module is required.  This module (in conjunction with PSCX)
   has the ability to recursively unzip files within the src zip file provided and also functionality for many other compression types. If the destination
   directory does not exist, it will be created before unzipping the file.  Specifying rm parameter will force removal of the src file after extraction.
