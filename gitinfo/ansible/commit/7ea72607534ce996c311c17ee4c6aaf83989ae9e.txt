    [ec2_launch_template] Update description of state param (#63147)
    
    ##### SUMMARY
    Currently, it is not possible to delete specific versions of an ec2 launch template. The module docs incorrectly suggest that there is a `version` param to the module that can be used to do that. This patch aims to correct that error.
