    Replace username for name in eos_user integration tests (#28067)
    
    username param is read by eos action plugion load_provider, if present
    it is set as the play context remote user.
    That means if you have a play remote_user: admin it won't be used, but instead
    whatever is put in the task argument username.
    Changing the tests to use name fixes the issue, we may want to remove username
    as valid module argument in other change.
