    Modules are almost always written now by mutliple authors, so don't show this field on website, since it grows obsolete and does not take into account all contributors.
    Contributors are still listed on github module source and in repo, and original authors still in the file for when development questions arise, but want
    to funnel support questions to the mailing list versus directly to them.
