commit 2e9fc918442bcc0eb5161e1e8c179348793a1818
Author: Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 23 13:49:20 2016 +0100

    Various improvements to issue/pull-request templates
    
    - Instruct to verify if an issue/request already exists
    - Use uppercase for titles (easier to parse as titles)
    - Remove empty lines where it makes sense (instructions)
    - Ensure that commit-message appears directly under summary (pull-requests)
