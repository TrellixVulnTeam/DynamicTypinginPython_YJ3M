    Update django_manage documentation
    
    As of Ansible 2.x, invocation of Django's ```manage.py``` requires a valid "shebang". Additionally, ```manage.py``` must be executable.
    The old invocation was hardcoded as ```python manage.py ...``` while the new invocation is ```./manage.py ...```. See [this PR](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/1165).
    This change allows more flexibility for which Python interpreter is invoked, but breaks existing deployment when ```manage.py``` is not properly configured. This documentation update adds a note explaining the new requirements for ```manage.py```.
