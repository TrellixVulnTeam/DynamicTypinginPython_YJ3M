commit f58899eef7bce5a682a52d33914d644e494ff898
Author: Toshio Kuratomi <a.badger@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 5 10:14:17 2019 -0700

    Update release name for 2.10
    
    Add a list of previously used release names to make it easy to tell what
    release names are no longer usable.
    
    Add a test that new release names have been added to the used list.
    
    Fixes #61616
