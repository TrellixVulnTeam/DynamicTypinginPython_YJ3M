    Remove misleading statement passwords must be same (#49798)
    
    * Remove misleading statement passwords must be same
    
    Since 2.4 Ansible has supported multiple vault passwords:
    <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#multiple-vault-passwords>
    
    Meaning lines like the following are misleading:
    
    > The password used with vault currently must be the same for all files you wish
    > to use together at the same time.
    
    -- `docs/docsite/rst/user_guide/vault.rst`
    
    To demonstrate this with Ansible 2.7, save the following as `example.yaml`:
    
    ```
    - name: Display output from two vaults with different passwords
      hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      vars_files: [one.yaml, two.yaml]
      tasks:
        - name: View secret from one.yaml vault
          debug: { var: one }
        - name: View secret from two.yaml vault
          debug: { var: two }
    ```
    
    Then run the three following commands choosing two different passwords:
    
    ```
    $ echo 'one: 1' | ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id id1@prompt --output=one.yaml
    $ echo 'two: 2' | ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id id2@prompt --output=two.yaml
    $ ansible-playbook --vault-id id1@prompt --vault-id id2@prompt example.yaml
    ```
    
    `ansible-vault` stores an ID in plain text in the vault file.
    
    * Remove note about default in Ansible 2.1
