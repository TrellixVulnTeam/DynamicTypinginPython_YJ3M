+  - 'Yum itself has two types of groups.  "Package groups" are specified in the
+    rpm itself while "environment groups" are specified in a separate file

+    apparent to ansible users because ansible needs to operate on the group
+    of packages in a single transaction and yum requires groups to be specified
+    in different ways when used in that way.  Package groups are specified as
+    "@development-tools" and environment groups are "@^gnome-desktop-environment'.
+    Use the "yum group list" command to see which category of group the group
+    you want to install falls into.'
