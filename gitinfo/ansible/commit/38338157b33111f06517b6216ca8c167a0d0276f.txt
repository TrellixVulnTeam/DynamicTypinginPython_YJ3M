 By default, Powershell remoting enables an HTTP listener. The following commands enable an HTTPS listener, which secures communication between the Control Machine and windows.
 
 An SSL certificate for server authentication is required to create the HTTPS listener. The existence of an existing certificate in the computer account can be verified by using the MMC snap-in, as documented '

+Additionally, Powershell 3.0 or higher is needed for most modules.  You can actually use a minimal

+Looking at an ansible checkout, copy the examples/scripts/upgrade_ps2_to_3.ps1 script from the repo into

+     tasks:
+       - script: upgrade_ps2_to_3.ps1

+The hosts in the above group will then be running a new enough version of Powershell to be managed
+by the full compliment of Ansible modules.
