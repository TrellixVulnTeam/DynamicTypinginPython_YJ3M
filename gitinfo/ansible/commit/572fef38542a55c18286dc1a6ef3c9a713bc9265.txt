 Ansible is an IT automation tool.  It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks
 such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.
 
-Ansible's goals are foremost those of simplicity and maximum ease of use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring a minimum of moving parts, usage of Open SSH for transport (with an accelerated socket mode as an alternative that uses SSH for key exchange), and a language that is designed around auditability by humans -- even those not familiar with the program.

 Ansible manages machines in an agentless manner. There is never a question of how to
 upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled.  As OpenSSH is one of the most peer reviewed open source components, the security exposure of using the tool is greatly reduced.  Ansible is decentralized -- it relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines; if needed it can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized authentication management systems.
