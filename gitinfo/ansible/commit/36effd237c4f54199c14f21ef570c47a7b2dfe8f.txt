commit 36effd237c4f54199c14f21ef570c47a7b2dfe8f
Author: Michael DeHaan <michael.dehaan@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 27 21:23:03 2013 -0500

    There's a cleaner way to do this, commit to module formatter pending.
    
    Revert "No longer need to reference 'version_added' in docs for these, as this was quite a while ago."
    
    This reverts commit ff0a41d446a03f93aa57a6baa96c5333bea269ea.
