    Docs: accelerate mode -> accelerated mode
    
    The docs sometimes referred to "accelerated mode" as "accelerate mode".
    This patch changes it to "accelerated mode" everywhere.

 While OpenSSH using the ControlPersist feature is quite fast and scalable, there is a certain small amount of overhead involved in
 using SSH connections.  While many people will not encounter a need, if you are running on a platform that doesn't have ControlPersist support (such as an EL6 control machine), you'll probably be even more interested in tuning options.

+Accelerated mode is there to help connections work faster, but still uses SSH for initial secure key exchange.  There is no
 additional public key infrastructure to manage, and this does not require things like NTP or even DNS. 
 
 Accelerated mode can be anywhere from 2-6x faster than SSH with ControlPersist enabled, and 10x faster than paramiko.
