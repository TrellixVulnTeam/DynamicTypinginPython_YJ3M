    Be consistent in the documentation
    
    The documentation for the `state` field is not very clear.
    
    It says possible values are "installed, uninstalled" and default value is "present"
    The examples below alow uses `present` and `absent`.
    
    This patch uses "absent" and "present" instead of "installed" and "uninstalled"
    
    Moreover, this is consistent with other packaging modules, like homebrew itself
