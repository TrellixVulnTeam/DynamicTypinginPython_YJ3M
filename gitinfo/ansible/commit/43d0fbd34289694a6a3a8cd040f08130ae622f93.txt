    Add a better error message for service
    
    While migrating my playbook to a newer ansible version, I faced
    the error message "unknown init system, cannot enable service". It turned
    out to be caused by a wrong service name that was not expanded anymore.
    
    So by giving the name of the service that cannot be enabled and a more precise
    reason, i think people will be able to diagnose their issue more easily.
