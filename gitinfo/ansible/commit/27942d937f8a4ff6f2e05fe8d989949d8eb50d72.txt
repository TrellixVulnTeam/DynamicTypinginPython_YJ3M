    Network requirements to be installed by ansible-test (#40042)
    
    Previously the test framework (DCI, Zuul) were installing the various
    dependencies, this meant the list of what was required was duplicated.
    
    Having everything defined in ansible-test makes it easier for people to
    run tests locally.
    
    Also this allows the test to work correctly on Python 2 & Python 3
