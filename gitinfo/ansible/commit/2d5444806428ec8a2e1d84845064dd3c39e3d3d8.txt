+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us.
+
+We really like this idea, particularly:
+
+   * INSERT REASONS!
+
+It might take us a little while to get to this one.  Just as a quick reminder of things, this is a really busy project.  We have over 800 contributors and to manage the queue effectively
+we assign things a priority between P1 (highest) and P5.  
+
+We may also ask some questions and it may be a while before we can get to this, but we'd like to thank you very much for your time!  
+We'll work things in priority order, so just wanted you to be aware of the queue and know we haven't forgot about you!
+
+We will definitely see your comments on this issue when reading this ticket, but may not be able to reply promptly.  You may also wish to join one of our two mailing lists
