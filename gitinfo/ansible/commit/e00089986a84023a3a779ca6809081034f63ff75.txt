 short_description: Runs ngen to recompile DLLs after .NET  updates
 description:
     - After .NET framework is installed/updated, Windows will probably want to recompile things to optimise for the host.
     - This happens via scheduled task, usually at some inopportune time.
     - This module allows you to run this task on your own schedule, so you incur the CPU hit at some more convenient and controlled time.

-    - Note: there are in fact two scheduled tasks for ngen but they have no triggers so aren't a problem
-    - Note: there's no way to test if they've been completed (?)
