+PowerShell 3.0 or higher is needed for most provided Ansible modules for Windows, and is also required to run the above setup script. Note that PowerShell 3.0 is only supported on Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP1, and later releases of Windows.
 
 Looking at an ansible checkout, copy the `examples/scripts/upgrade_to_ps3.ps1 <https://github.com/cchurch/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/upgrade_to_ps3.ps1>`_ script onto the remote host and run a PowerShell console as an administrator.  You will now be running PowerShell 3 and can try connectivity again using the win_ping technique referenced above.
