commit 9d9a451b3459fad615a87982dce7d2e68cecf29e
Author: James Cammarata <jimi@sngx.net>

    Simply being in an always block shouldn't mean a host did not fail
    
    Previously the changed code was necessary, however it is now problematic
    as we've started using the is_failed() method in other places in the code.
    Additional changes at the strategy layer should make this safe to remove
    now.
    
    Fixes #15625
