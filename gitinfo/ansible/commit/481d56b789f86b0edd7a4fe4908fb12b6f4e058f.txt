+
+* Fixes a major compatibility break in the synchronize module shipped with
+  2.0.0.x.  That version of synchronize ran sudo on the controller prior to
+  running rsync.  In 1.9.x and previous, sudo was run on the host that rsync
+  connected to.  2.0.1 restores the 1.9.x behaviour.
+* Additionally, several other problems with where synchronize chose to run when
+  combined with delegate_to were fixed.  In particular, if a playbook targetted
+  localhost and then delegated_to a remote host the prior behavior (in 1.9.x
+  and 2.0.0.x) was to copy files between the src and destination directories on
+  the delegated host.  This has now been fixed to copy between localhost and
+  the delegated host.
+* Fix a regression where synchronize was unable to deal with unicode paths.
+* Fix a regression where synchronize deals with inventory hosts that use
+  localhost but with an alternate port.
+* Fixes a regression where the retry files feature was not implemented.
+* Fixes a regression where the any_errors_fatal option was implemented in 2.0
+  incorrectly, and also adds a feature where any_errors_fatal can be set at
+  the block level.
+* Fix tracebacks when playbooks or ansible itself were located in directories
+  with unicode characters.
+* Fix bug when sending unicode characters to an external pager for display.
+* Fix a bug with squashing loops for special modules (mostly package managers).
+  The optimization was squashing when the loop did not apply to the selection
+  of packages.  This has now been fixed.
+* Temp files created when using vault are now "shredded" using the unix shred
+  program which overwrites the file with random data.
+* Some fixes to cloudstack modules for case sensitivity
+* Fix non-newstyle modules (non-python modules and old-style modules) to
+  disabled pipelining.
+* Fix fetch module failing even if fail_on_missing is set to False
+* Fix for cornercase when local connections, sudo, and raw were used together.
