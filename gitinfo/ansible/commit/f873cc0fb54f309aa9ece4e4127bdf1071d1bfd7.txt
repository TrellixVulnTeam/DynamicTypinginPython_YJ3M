 ==========
 
 Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to
-execute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer. 
-This can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled, however when using "sudo:" operations you must
-first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts.
-
-By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
-sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros), but is highly
-recommended if you can enable it, eliminating the need for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`::

+execute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer.
+This can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
+As of Ansible 2.1.0 this option is enabled by default.
+
+In previous versions, this option was disabled because of a bad interaction
+with some sudo configurations.  If sudo was configured to 'requiretty' for
+operation then pipelining would not work and ansible would fail to connect
+properly.  This could be remedied by removing 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on
+all managed hosts.
+
+It is recommended to leave this option enabled.  If you are stuck with an old
+version of ansible your first choice option should be to remove requiretty
+from the sudoers configuration and only disable pipelining if you cannot do
+that.  Enabling this eliminates the need for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`::
+
+    pipelining=True
