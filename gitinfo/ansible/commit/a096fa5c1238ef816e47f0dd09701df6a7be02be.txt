+Variables defined in the playbooks or inventory can also be used, just make sure to apply the `|bool` filter to non boolean variables (ex: string variables with content like 'yes', 'on', '1', 'true').  An example may be the execution of a task based on a variable's boolean value::
 
     vars:
       epic: true
+      monumental: "yes"
 
 Then a conditional execution might look like::
 
     tasks:
         - shell: echo "This certainly is epic!"
-          when: epic
+          when: epic or monumental|bool
