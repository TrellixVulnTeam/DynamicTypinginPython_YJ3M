 Ansible is pluggable in a lot of other ways seperate from inventory scripts and callbacks.  Many of these features are there to cover
 fringe use cases and are infrequently needed, and others are pluggable simply because they are there to implement core features
 in ansible and were most convient to be made pluggable.

+Ansible is an IT automation tool.  It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks

+Ansible's goals are foremost those of simplicity and ease of use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring
+a minimum of moving parts, usage of Open SSH for transport (with an accelerated socket mode as an alternative that uses SSH for key exchange), and a language that is designed around auditability by humans -- even those not familiar with the program.
 
-This documentation covers the current released version of Ansible (1.3.X) and also some development version features (1.4).  For recent features, in each section, the version of Ansible where the feature is added is indicated.  Ansible produces a new major release approximately
-every 2 months.
+Ansible manages machines in an agentless manner --  the intent here is to make things more reliable and 
+there are no additional open ports.   This also means there is never a question of how to
+upgrade the management software with the management software, or the problem of not being able to manage remote nodes because
+management daemons are not yet installed or not currently running.  As OpenSSH is one of the most peer reviewed open source components, the security exposure of using the tool is therefore also greatly reduced.  Ansible is decentralized, and relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines, rather than just who can edit configuration recipes in source control.
 
-Before we dive into playbooks, configuration management, deployment, and orchestration, we'll learn how to get Ansible installed and some
-basic information.  We'll go over how to execute ad-hoc commands in parallel across your nodes using /usr/bin/ansible.  We'll also see
-what sort of modules are available in Ansible's core (though you can also write your own, which we'll also show later).

For recent features, in each section, the version of Ansible where the feature is added is indicated.  Ansible produces a new major release approximately every 2 months.  The core project moves somewhat conservatively, valuing simplicity in language design and setup, while the community around new modules and plugins being developed and contributed moves very quickly, typically adding 20 or so new modules in each release.

+Ansible modules are resources that are distributed to remote nodes to make them perform particular tasks or match a particular

+IT tasks in the core distribution.  This means modules are well up-to-date and you don't have to hunt for an implementation

+Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language.  They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.
 
 At a basic level, playbooks can be used to manage configurations of and deployments to remote machines.  At a more advanced level, they can sequence multi-tier rollouts involving rolling updates, and can delegate actions to other hosts, interacting with monitoring servers and load balancers along the way.

+While there's a lot of information here, there's no need to learn everything at once.  You can start small and pick up more features
 over time as you need them.  
 
 Playbooks are designed to be human-readable and are developed in a basic text language.  There are multiple
 ways to organize playbooks and the files they include, and we'll offer up some suggestions on that and making the most out of Ansible.
