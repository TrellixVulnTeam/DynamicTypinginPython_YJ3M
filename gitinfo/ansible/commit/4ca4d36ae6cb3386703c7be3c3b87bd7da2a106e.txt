    Change syslog (priority) level from LOG_NOTICE to LOG_INFO
    
    If you look at the meaning of the different syslog levels, NOTICE means that the event may need someone to look at it. Whereas INFO is pure informational.
    
    Since module invocations are in fact requested (deliberate) actions, they shouldn't need any additional post-processing, and therefore should not be logged as NOTICE.
    
    This may seem like hairsplitting, but correctly categorizing system events helps weeding through the noise downhill.
    
    According to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog
    
    5       Notice          notice  Events that are unusual but not error conditions .
    6       Informational   info            Normal operational messages -no action required. Example an application has started, paused or ended successfully.
