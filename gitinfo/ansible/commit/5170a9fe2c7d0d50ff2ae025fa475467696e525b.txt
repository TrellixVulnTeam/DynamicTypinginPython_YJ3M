 Ansible is a extra-simple Python API for doing 'remote things' over SSH.  
 
-As Func, which I co-wrote, aspired to avoid using SSH and have it's own daemon infrastructure, Ansible aspires to be quite different and more minimal, but still able to grow more modularly over time.

 Principles
 ==========
 
-* Dead simple setup
-* No server or client daemons, uses existing SSHd
-* Only SSH keys are allowed for authentication
-* usage of ssh-agent is more or less required
-* plugins can be written in ANY language
-* as with Func, API usage is an equal citizen to CLI usage
