 Setting the Python interpreter

-To support a variety of Unix/Linux operating systems and distributions, Ansible cannot always rely on the existing environment or ``env`` variables to locate the correct Python binary. By default, modules point at ``/usr/bin/python`` as this is the most common location. On BSD variants, this path may differ, so it is advised to inform Ansible of the binary's location, through the ``ansible_python_interpreter`` inventory variable. For example:
