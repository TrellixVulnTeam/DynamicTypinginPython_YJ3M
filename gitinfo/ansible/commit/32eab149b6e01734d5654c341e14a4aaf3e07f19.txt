 In Ansible 2.7 a new module argument named ``public`` was added to the ``include_role`` module that dictates whether or not the role's ``defaults`` and ``vars`` will be exposed outside of the role, allowing those variables to be used by later tasks.  This value defaults to ``public: False``, matching current behavior.
 
-``import_role`` does not support the ``public`` argument, and will unconditionally expose the role's ``defaults`` and ``vars`` to the rest of the playbook. This functinality brings ``import_role`` into closer alignment with roles listed within the ``roles`` header in a play.
+``import_role`` does not support the ``public`` argument, and will unconditionally expose the role's ``defaults`` and ``vars`` to the rest of the playbook. This functionality brings ``import_role`` into closer alignment with roles listed within the ``roles`` header in a play.
 
 There is an important difference in the way that ``include_role`` (dynamic) will expose the role's variables, as opposed to ``import_role`` (static). ``import_role`` is a pre-processor, and the ``defaults`` and ``vars`` are evaluated at playbook parsing, making the variables available to tasks and roles listed at any point in the play. ``include_role`` is a conditional task, and the ``defaults`` and ``vars`` are evaluated at execution time, making the variables available to tasks and roles listed *after* the ``include_role`` task.
