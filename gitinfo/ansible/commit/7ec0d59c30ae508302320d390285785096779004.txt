+Failure to Load Builtin Modules
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+If powershell fails with an error message similar to ``The 'Out-String' command was found in the module 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility', but the module could not be loaded.``
+then there could be a problem trying to access all the paths specified by the ``PSModulePath`` environment variable.
+A common cause of this issue is that the ``PSModulePath`` environment variable contains a UNC path to a file share and
+because of the double hop/credential delegation issue the Ansible process cannot access these folders. The way around
+this problems is to either:
+
+* Remove the UNC path from the ``PSModulePath`` environment variable, or
+* Use an authentication option that supports credential delegation like ``credssp`` or ``kerberos`` with credential delegation enabled

+See `KB4076842 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4076842>`_ for more information on this problem.
