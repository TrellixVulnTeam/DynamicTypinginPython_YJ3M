    Update 'patch' documentation for src, remote_src, backup and binary.
    
    The patch module has a few missing items, and inconsistencies, in its
    documentation. A few of which are addressed here.
    
    Within Ansible documentation, the choices for boolean values are
    commonly 'yes', and 'no'. We standardise the options on that.
    
    'remote_src' documentation uses 'False' and 'True' for its documentation,
    so these have been updated in both the choices and default.
    
    'src' documentation refers to 'remote_src', so is updated to use
    the 'no' choice.
    
    'backup' did not describe its options and default at all, so we add
    them.
    
    'binary' default used 'False', but specified the type as 'bool' which is
    implicitly documented as 'yes'/'no', so we make that 'no' as well.
