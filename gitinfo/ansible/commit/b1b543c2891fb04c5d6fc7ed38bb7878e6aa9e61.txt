+Ansible Debian Package
+======================
+
+To create an Ansible DEB package:
+
+    sudo apt-get install cdbs debhelper dpkg-dev git-core reprepro
+    git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
+    cd ansible
+    make deb
+
+The debian package file will be placed in the `../` directory. This can then be added to an APT repository or installed with `dpkg -l`.
+
+Note that `dpkg -i` does not resolve dependencies

-I have added a debian folder for use in building a .deb file for ansible. From the ansible directory you can run the following command to construct a debian package of ansible.
-
-~/ansible$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot
-
-The debian package files will be placed in the ../ directory and can be installed with the following command:
-~/$ sudo dpkg -i .deb
-
-Dpkg -i doesn't resolve dependencies, so if the previous command fails because of dependencies, you will need to run the following to install the dependencies (if needed) and then re-run the dpkg -i command to install the package:
-$ sudo apt-get -f install
