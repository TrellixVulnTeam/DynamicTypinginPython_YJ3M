    Clarify json behavior with return_content key (#53316)
    
    The docs were not clear enough about what would happen if a JSON response is read.
    
    The actual behavior is that the `json` key is always present in such cases, regardless of this parameter, so by changing a few words, we make the docs clearer to the reader.
