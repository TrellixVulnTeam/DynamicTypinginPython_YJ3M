    Add or later to the license expressed in the README
    
    This is a clarification, not a relicensing.
    
    Our source code says "GPLv3+" or "version 3 of the License, or later".
    Our documentation says GPLv3+:
    
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.rst#contributing-to-ansible-objective-requirements
    
    We were just lazy when we wrote the README and left out the "or later".
    this update to the README brings it in line with what everything else
    says.
