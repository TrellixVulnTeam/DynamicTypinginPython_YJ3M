 The vault feature can encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible.  This can include "group_vars/" or "host_vars/" inventory variables, variables loaded by "include_vars" or "vars_files", or variable files passed on the ansible-playbook command line with "-e @file.yml" or "-e @file.json".  Role variables and defaults are also included!
 
-Ansible tasks, handlers, and so on are also data so these can be encrypted with vault as well. If you don't want to even reveal the variables you are using you can go as far as keeping individual task files entirely encrypted. However, that might be a little too much and could annoy your coworkers :)
