 Ansible Community  Information
-------------------------------

-Purpose
-=======
+==============================
 
 The purpose of the Ansible community is to  unite developers, system administrators, operations, and IT managers to share and build great automation solutions.
 
+This document contains all sorts of information about how to contribute and interact with Ansible.  Welcome!
+
 Ways to Interact
 ================
 
 There are a lot of ways to join and  be a part  of the  Ansible community.
 
 Sharing Ansible with Others
-===========================
+---------------------------
 
 You can help share Ansible with others by telling friends and colleagues ,  writing a lblog post, or presenting at user groups (like DevOps groups or the local LUG or BUG).  You are also welcome to share slides on speakerdeck, sign up for a free account and tag it “Ansible”.   On Twitter, you can also share things with #ansible.
 
 Sharing Tips and Tricks
-=======================
+-----------------------
 
 Join the Ansible mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project) and  you can share playbooks you may have written and other interesting implementation stories.   Put your Ansible content up on places like github  to share with others.
 
 Sharing A Feature Idea
-======================
+----------------------
 
 If you have an idea for a new feature, you can open a new ticket at (https://github.com/ansible/ansible), though in general we like to talk about feature ideas first and bring in lots of people into the discussion.   Consider stopping by Ansible project mailing list at (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project).  
 
 Helping with Documentation
-==========================
+--------------------------
 
 Ansible documentation is a community project too!  If you would like to help with the documentation, whether correcting a typo or improving a section, or maybe even documenting a new feature, submit a github pull request to  the code that lives in the “docsite/latest/rst” subdirectory of the project.   Docs are in restructured text format.  If you aren’t comfortable with restructured text, you can also open a ticket on github about any errors you spot or sections you would like to see added. For more information on creating pull requests, please refer to the github help guide: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

 The proverbial 'Zen of Ansible' encourages simple, readable code and consistent, conservatively extending, backwards-compatible improvements.  Code developed for Ansible needs to support Python 2.6+, while code in modules must run under Python 2.4 or higher.
