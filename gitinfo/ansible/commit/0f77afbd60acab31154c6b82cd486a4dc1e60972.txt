    Change play timeout for persistent connection command timeout (#27948)
    
    There's been a change in persistent connect framework that switches
    playbook timeout (which corresponds to 'timeout' param) to command_timeout.
    While we fix this and return the functionality, let's put the command_timeout
    in place to avoid CI being red.
