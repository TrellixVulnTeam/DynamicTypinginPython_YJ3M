    Rename issue_template.md back to ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
    
    I can only assume that it was renamed because Github suddenly started
    to act on ISSUE_TEMPLATE; but that's what we want now, so back it goes.

diff --git a/issue_template.md b/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
similarity index 100%
rename from issue_template.md
rename to ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
