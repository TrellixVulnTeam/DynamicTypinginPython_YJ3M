When using Enterprise Linux 6 operating systems as the control machine (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS), however, the version of OpenSSH may be too old to support Control Persist. On these operating systems, Ansible will fallback into using a high-quality python implementation of
 OpenSSH called 'paramiko'.  If you wish to use features like Kerberized SSH and more, consider using Fedora, OS X, or Ubuntu as your control machine until a newer version of OpenSSH is available for your platform -- or engage 'accelerated mode' in Ansible.  See :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`.
