commit d168c709d5288ba2a5c8956f011170e85c423c46
Author: Michael DeHaan <michael.dehaan@gmail.com>

    Fix an issue where the ordering of an include statement is processed ahead of the conditional in the included statement,
    which required a redundant check to see if a variable was defined rather than short circuiting.
    
    Fixes #4469
