    Fix documentation link to issue template
    
    On the Ansible Community page (http://docs.ansible.com/community.html)
    in the "I'd like to report a bug" section, the link to the "issue
    template" is broken - it links to URL
    https://raw2.github.com/ansible/ansible/devel/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, which
    results in a GitHub 404 (Page not found) error page .
    
    Fix points link to a URL that works.
