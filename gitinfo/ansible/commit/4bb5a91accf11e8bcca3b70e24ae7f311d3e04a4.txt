 Become and Networks
 ===================
 
-As of version 2.6, Ansible supports ``become`` for privilege escalation (entering ``enable`` mode or privileged EXEC mode) on all :ref:`Ansible-maintained platforms<network_supported>` that support ``enable`` mode: `eos``, ``ios``, and ``nxos``. Using ``become`` replaces the ``authorize`` and ``auth_pass`` options in a ``provider`` dictionary.

 You must set the connection type to either ``connection: network_cli`` or ``connection: httpapi`` to use ``become`` for privilege escalation on network devices. Check the :ref:`platform_options` and :ref:`network_modules` documentation for details.
