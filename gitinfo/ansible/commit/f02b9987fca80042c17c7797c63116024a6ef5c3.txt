    We all agreed on the list that the ansible module common module snippet, since it's dynamically embedded in modules on the fly, should
    be a BSD licensed snippet so that it's ok to write proprietary modules.  The actual license of Ansible (GPLv3) or any modules
    written for ansible (any) do not change.
