    Fix installation instructions link in the README (#24754)
    
    * Fix the installation instructions link in the README
    
    The original linked page (Getting started) assumed the user already had an installed system, which clearly was not the intention of the link.
    So I replaced it with a link to the installation instructions, and removed the quick advice. The installation instructions are well structured and complete.
    
    * Change to https
    
    Links to ansible.com should end up over https
    Seem to be missing the http -> https redirect from the docs site, I'll poke someone about that
