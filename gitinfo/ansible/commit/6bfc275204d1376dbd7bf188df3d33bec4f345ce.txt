 TODO list and plans
 ===================
 
+Playbook TODO:
+
+   * error codes and failure summaries
+   * create modules that return 'changed' attributes
+   * fail nodes on errors, i.e. remove from host list, rather than continuing to pound them
+   * further improve output
+   * more conditional capability
+   * very good logging
+
+General:
+
+   * logging
+   * async options
    * modules for users, groups, and files, using puppet style ensure mechanics
+   * very simple option constructing/parsing for modules
+   * templating module (how might this work syntax wise?) with facter/ohai awareness
+      * probably could lay down a values.json file 
+      * use copy capabilities to move files to tmp, run python templating
+      * maybe support templating engine of choice
+   * think about how to build idempotency guards around command module?
+   * think about how to feed extra JSON data onto system
+
+Bonus utilities:
+
    * ansible-inventory - gathering fact/hw info, storing in git, adding RSS
    * ansible-slurp - recursively rsync file trees for each host
-   * very simple option constructing/parsing for modules
-   * Dead-simple declarative configuration management engine using
-     a runbook style recipe file, written in JSON or YAML
    * maybe it's own fact engine, not required, that also feeds from facter
-   * add/remove/list hosts from the command line
+
+Not so interested really, but maybe:
+
    * list available modules from command line
+   * add/remove/list hosts from the command line
    * filter exclusion (run this only if fact is true/false)
+     -- should be doable with playbooks (i.e. not neccessary)
