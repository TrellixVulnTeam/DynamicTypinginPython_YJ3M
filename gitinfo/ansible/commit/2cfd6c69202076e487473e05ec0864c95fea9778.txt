    Change old recommendation about insecure variables (#18493)
    
    * Change old recommendation about insecure variables
    
    These warnings were relevant before ansible had the secure vault feature:
    any secret put into a variable used to be a bad idea.
    
    With the vault feature (available since ansible 1.5) it's no longer a bad
    idea to use these variables, as long as they aren't stored in plain text.
    
    * Update intro_inventory.rst
    
    Minor edit
