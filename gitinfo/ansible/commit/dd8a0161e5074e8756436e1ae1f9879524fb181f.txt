+Cannot Reproduce
+================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
+
+Testing this on the version you have specified, we cannot reproduce this problem.
+
+Our reasons and evidence for this are:
+
+   * INSERT HERE
+
+And we suggest that:
+
+   * INSERT THINGS TO DO HERE
+
+As such, we are most likely going to close this ticket.  Should you disagree with this conclusion, you may also wish to join one of our two mailing lists
+which is very active:
+
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project - for user questions, tips, and tricks
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for strategy, future planning, and questions about writing code
+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
+
