    Add single quotes around package name (#45152)
    
    <!--- Your description here -->
    `pip install ansible[azure]` results in `zsh: no matches found: ansible[azure]` at least in my computer (zsh on Ubuntu). I don't know if it is the case with all shells, but at least for me it is. Since square brackets `[]` are special characters in bash, I propose adding single quotes to make sure that package name is always interpreted as literal. The same error is also resolvable by setting noglob.

 If you are running Ansible from source, you can install the dependencies from the
 root directory of the Ansible repo.
