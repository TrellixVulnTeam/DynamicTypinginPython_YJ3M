    Do not register variable if host has been skipped
    
    Executive summary: skipping a host corrupts a variable (when it is registered)
    
    We have a play existing out of multiple tasks that check a condition, if one of these tasks fails we want to skip all next tasks in the playbook. I noticed that if we skip a task because a certain condition is met, and this task has a register-attribute, I loose the value in the variable. Which means we cannot use that variable in subsequent tasks to evaluate because it was skipped:
    
    ```
    - action: command test -d /some/directory
      register: task
    
    - action: command test -f /some/directory/file
      register: task
      only_if: '${task.rc} == 0'
    
    - action: do something else
      only_if: '${task.rc} == 0'
    ```
    
    In the above example, if the second task is skipped (because the first failed), the third action will end with a "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" complaining about the unsubstituted ${task.rc} (even though it was set by the first task and used for skipping the second).
    
    The following play demonstrates the problem:
    
    ```
    - name: Test register on ignored tasks
      hosts: all
      gather_facts: no
    
      vars:
        skip: true
        task: { 'rc': 666 }
    
      tasks:
      - action: debug msg='skip = ${skip}, task.rc = ${task.rc}'
    
      - name: Skip this task, just to test if task has changed
        action: command ls
        register: task
        only_if: '${skip} != True'
    
      - action: debug msg='skip = ${skip}, task.rc = ${task.rc}'
    
      - name: Now use task value
        action: command echo 'Works !'
        only_if: '${task.rc} == 0'
    ```
    
    And the enclosed fix, fixes the above problem.
