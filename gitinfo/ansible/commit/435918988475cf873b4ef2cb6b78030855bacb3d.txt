    Update playbooks_lookups.rst
    
    I was caught out by the different behaviour of lookups & local tasks, and could not find the difference documented anywhere at all, so I took the liberty of proposing this change.
    
    Lookups are always relative to the role or play.
    Local tasks are relative to the cwd from which you execute.
