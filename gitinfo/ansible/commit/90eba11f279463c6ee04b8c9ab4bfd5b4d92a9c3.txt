-TODO list and plans
-===================
-
-Playbook TODO:
-
-   * error codes and failure summaries
-   * handle 'changed' attributes
-   * fail nodes on errors, i.e. remove from host list, rather than continuing to pound them
-   * further improve output
-   * more conditional capability (if statement) (?)
-   * very good logging
-
-Command module:
-   * magic to pull async & timeout options off of the command line and not feed them
-     to the app we're executing
- 
-General:
-
-   * better logging
-   * async options
-   * modules for users, groups, and files, using puppet style ensure mechanics
-   * think about how to build idempotency (aka Puppet-style 'creates') around command module?
-
-Bonus utilities:
-
-   * ansible-inventory - gathering fact/hw info, storing in git, adding RSS
-   * ansible-slurp - recursively rsync file trees for each host
-   * maybe it's own fact engine, not required, that also feeds from facter
-
-Not so interested really, but maybe:
-
-   * list available modules from command line
-   * add/remove/list hosts from the command line
-   * filter exclusion (run this only if fact is true/false)
-     -- should be doable with playbooks (i.e. not neccessary)
