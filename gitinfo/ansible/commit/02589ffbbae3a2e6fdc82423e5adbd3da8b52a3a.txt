    Fix formatting of Groups of Groups
    
    The example in the Groups of Groups section was being rendered as a quote.
    Switching to the `::` notation causes it to render as preformatted text instead.
    This could have also been done with a `.. code:` block, but I chose to be
    consistent with other sections in the document.
