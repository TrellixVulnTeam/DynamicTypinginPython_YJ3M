    Rename the type filter to type_debug
    
    Because we add the names of all filters to the callable whitelist used
    by safe_eval, adding a filter named type makes it so code calling "type()"
    gets eval'd.  We can't think of a way to exploit this but it's
    sufficiently sketchy that we're renaming it in case someone smarter than
    us can think of a problem.

+Use the ``type_debug`` filter to display the underlying Python type of a variable.
 This can be useful in debugging in situations where you may need to know the exact
 type of a variable::
 
-    {{ myvar | type }}
+    {{ myvar | type_debug }}
 
 
 A few useful filters are typically added with each new Ansible release.  The development documentation shows
