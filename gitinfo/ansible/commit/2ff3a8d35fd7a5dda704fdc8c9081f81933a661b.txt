    Updated lxc_container module to fix option parsing
    
    The option parsing object within the module was performing a split
    on an '=' sign and assuming that there would only ever be one '='
    in a user provided option. Sadly, the assumption is incorrect and
    the list comprehension that is building the options list needs to
    be set to split on the first occurrence of an '=' sign in a given
    option string. This commit adds the required change to make it
    possible for options to contain additional '=' signs and be handled
    correctly.
