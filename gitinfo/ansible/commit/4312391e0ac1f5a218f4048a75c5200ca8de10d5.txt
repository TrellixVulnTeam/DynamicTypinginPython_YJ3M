commit 4312391e0ac1f5a218f4048a75c5200ca8de10d5
Author: Michael DeHaan <michael.dehaan@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 5 20:08:31 2014 -0400

    (A) Fix a bug in the doc generator that was clobbering the force parameter for the copy module.
    
    (B) This is a work in progress but the idea is to have text snippets where we can respond to tickets with a bit more helpful info.

+Should This Be Filed Elsewhere?
+===============================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
+
+This appears to be something that should be filed against another project or bug tracker, and let us explain our reasons for thinking this:
+
+   * FILL IN
+
+If you can stop by the tracker or forum for one of those projects, we'd appreciate it.  
+
+Should you still wish to discuss things further, or if you disagree with our thought process, please stop by one of our two mailing lists:
+
+  * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project
+  * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel
+
+We'd be happy to discuss things.
+
+Thank you once again!

+Cleanup Request
+===============
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
+
+We do require submissions to be free of merge commits, which cause difficulties in reviewing and merging code, and also affect the history of the source tree.
+To resolve this problem, it may be helpful to create a new branch and cherry-pick commits onto it.
+
+   * In general, always start a "topic branch" named after each thing you would like to contribute
+   * use "git pull --rebase" vs "git pull" to stay in tune with upstream, as well as "git rebase" vs "git merge"
+   * if you have things broken out over many commits, consider submitting just one squashed commit that keeps the history concise
+
+Just as a quick reminder of things, this is a really busy project.  We have over 800 contributors and to manage the queue effectively
+we assign things a priority between P1 (highest) and P5.  We'd like to thank you very much for your time!  
+We'll work things in priority order, so just wanted you to be aware of the queue and know we haven't forgot about you!
+
+We will definitely see your comments on this issue when reading this ticket, but may not be able to reply promptly.  You may also wish to join one of our two mailing lists
+which is very active:
+
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for user questions, tips, and tricks
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project - for strategy, future planning, and questions about writing code
+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!

+Question About This One
+=======================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken time to contribute.
+
+Unfortunately, we're not sure if we want this feature in the program, and I don't want this to seem confrontational.  Our reasons for this are:
+
+   * (A) INSERT ITEM HERE
+
+However, we're absolutely always up for discussion.  Since this is a really busy project, we don't always see comments on closed tickets, but want to encourage
+open dialog.  You can stop by the development list, and we'd be glad to talk about it - and we might even be persuaded otherwise!
+
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for user questions, tips, and tricks
+
+In the future, sometimes starting a discussion on the development list prior to implenting a feature can make getting things included a little easier, but it's not always neccessary.
+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!

+Is This A Bug?
+==============
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us.
+
+We're not sure this is a bug, and we don't mean for this to be confrontational.  Let's explain what we're thinking:
+
+   * INSERT ITEM HERE
+
+As such, we're going to close this ticket.  However, we're open to being corrected, should you wish to discuss.  You can stop by one of our two mailing lists 
+to talk about this and we might be persuaded otherwise.

+
+Comments on closed tickets aren't something we monitor, so if you do disagree with this, a mailing list thread is probably appropriate.
