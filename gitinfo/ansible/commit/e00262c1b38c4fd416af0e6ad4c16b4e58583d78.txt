+
+`AnsibleWorks <http://ansibleworks.com>`_, who also sponsors the Ansible community, also produces 'AWX', which is a web-based solution that makes Ansible even more easy to use for IT teams of all kinds.  It's designed to be the hub for all of your automation tasks.
+
+AWX allows you to control access to who can access what, even allowing sharing of SSH credentials without someone being able to transfer those credentials.  Inventory can be graphically managed or synced with a wide variety of cloud sources.  It logs all of your jobs, integrates well with LDAP, and has an amazing browsable REST API.  Command line tools are available for easy integration
+with Jenkins as well.  
+
+Find out more about AWX features and how to download it on the `AWX webpage <http://ansibleworks.com/ansibleworks-awx>`_.  AWX
+is free for usage for up to 10 nodes, and comes bundled with amazing support from AnsibleWorks.  As you would expect, AWX is
+installed using Ansible playbooks!
