    Can we simplify _How to test a PR_? (#65383)
    
    Switch the instructions on testing PRs to use the `refs/pull/XXXX/head` refspec as described in [_Checking out pull requests locally_](https://help.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally#modifying-an-inactive-pull-request-locally).

 You can do this by:
 
 * checking out Ansible
-* making a test branch off the main branch
-* merging a GitHub issue
+* fetching the proposed changes into a test branch
 * testing

    It is important that the PR request target be ``ansible:devel``, as we do not accept pull requests into any other branch. Dot releases are cherry-picked manually by Ansible staff.

 .. note::
    If the GitHub user interface shows that the pull request will not merge cleanly, we do not recommend proceeding if you are not somewhat familiar with git and coding, as you will have to resolve a merge conflict. This is the responsibility of the original pull request contributor.
