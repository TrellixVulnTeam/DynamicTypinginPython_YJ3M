+Documenting new network platforms

+
+When you create network modules for a new platform, or modify the connections provided by an existing network platform(such as ``network_cli`` and ``httpapi``), you also need to update  the :ref:`settings_by_platform` table and add or modify the Platform Options file for your platform.
+
+You should already have documented each module as described in :ref:`developing_modules_documenting`.
+
+Modifying the platform options table
+====================================
+
+The :ref:`settings_by_platform` table is a convenient summary of the connections options provided by each network platform that has modules in Ansible. Add a row for your platform to this table, in alphabetical order.  For example:
+
+.. code-block:: text
+
+    +-------------------+-------------------------+-------------+---------+---------+----------+
+    | My OS             | ``myos``                | ✓           | ✓       |         | ✓        |
+
+Ensure that the table stays formatted correctly. That is:
+
+* Each row is inserted in alphabetical order.
+* The cell division ``|`` markers line up with the ``+`` markers.
+* The check marks appear only for the connection types provided by the network modules.
+
+
+
+Adding a platform-specific options section
+==========================================
+
+The platform- specific sections are individual ``.rst`` files that provide more detailed information for the users of your network platform modules.   Name your new file ``platform_<name>.rst`` (for example, ``platform_myos.rst``).  The platform name should match the module prefix. See `platform_eos.rst <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/network/user_guide/platform_eos.rst>`_ and :ref:`eos_platform_options` for an example of the details you should provide in your platform-specific options section.
+
+Your platform-specific section should include the following:
+
+* **Connections available table** - a deeper dive into each connection type, including details on credentials, indirect access, connections settings, and enable mode.
+* **How to use each connection type** - with working examples of each connection type.
+
+If your network platform supports SSH connections, also include the following at the bottom of your ``.rst`` file:
+
+.. code-block:: text
+
+    .. include:: shared_snippets/SSH_warning.txt
+
+Adding your new file to the table of contents
+=============================================
+
+As a final step, add your new file in alphabetical order in the ``platform_index.rst`` file. You should then build the documentation to verify your additions. See :ref:`community_documentation_contributions` for more details.
