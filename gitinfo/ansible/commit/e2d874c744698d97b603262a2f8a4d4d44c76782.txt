    Improve release and development cycle documentation
    
    This commit:
    - Adds a table highlighting the status of each version and provides
      a link to each major release's changelog
    - Re-inforces how stable versions are maintained and for how long
    - Moves this documentation out of the developer tree (this is
      interesting for users too!) while keeping a link there.

-Ansible supports the two most recent major, stable releases. Security- and bug-related fixes may be implemented in older versions, but this
-support is not guaranteed.

-If you are on a release older than the last two major, stable releases, please see our `Porting Guide <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/porting_guide_2.0.html>`_.

-````````````````
-Ansible is on a 'flexible' 4 month release schedule. Sometimes the release cycle can be extended if there is a major change that requires more time (for example, a core rewrite).
-Recently the main Ansible repo `merged <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/repomerge.html>`_ the separated ansible-modules-core and ansible-modules-extras repos, as such modules get released at the same time as the main Ansible repo.
-
-The major features and bugs fixed in a release should be reflected in the `CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md>`_. Minor features and bug fixes will be shown in the commit history. For example, `issue #19057 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19057>`_ is reflected only in the commit history.
-When a fix orfeature gets added to the `devel` branch it will be part of the next release. Some bugfixes can be backported to previous releases and will be part of a minor point release if such a release is deemed necessary.
-
-Sometimes a release candidate can be extended by a few days if a bug fix makes a change that can have far-reaching consequences, so users have enough time to find any new issues that may stem from this.

-Ansible normally goes through a 'release candidate', issuing an RC1 for a release. If no major bugs are discovered in the release candidate after 5 business days,  we'll get a final release. Otherwise, fixes will be applied and an RC2 will be provided for testing. If no bugs are discovered in RC2 after 2 days, the final release will be made, iterating this last step and incrementing the candidate number as we find major bugs.

-During the release candidate process, the focus will be on bugfixes that affect the RC, new features will be delayed while we try to produce a final version. Some bugfixes that are minor or don't affect the RC will also be postponed until after the release is finalized.

+=======================

+
+Release cycle
+`````````````
+
+Ansible is developed and released on a flexible 4 months release cycle.
+This cycle can be extended in order to allow for larger changes to be properly
+implemented and tested before a new release is made available.
+
+Ansible supports the two most recent major stable releases.
+For more information, read about the
+`development and stable version maintenance workflow`_.
+
+If you are using a release of Ansible that is no longer supported, we strongly
+encourage you to upgrade as soon as possible in order to benefit from the
+latest features and security fixes.
+
+Older unsupported versions of Ansible can contain unfixed security
+vulnerabilities (*CVE*).
+
+You can refer to the `porting guide`_ for tips on updating your Ansible
+playbooks to run on newer versions.

+
+The Ansible community develops and maintains Ansible on GitHub_.
+
+New modules, plugins, features and bugfixes will always be integrated in what
+will become the next major version of Ansible.
+This work is tracked on the ``devel`` git branch.
+
+Ansible provides bugfixes and security improvements for the most recent major
+release while the previous major release will only receive security patches.
+This work is tracked on the ``stable-<version>`` git branches.
+
+The fixes that land in supported stable branches will eventually be released
+as a new version when necessary.
+
+For more information on the changes included in each new version, you can refer
+to the changelog_, available on GitHub.
+
+Note that while there are no guarantees for providing fixes for unsupported
+releases of Ansible, there can sometimes be exceptions for critical issues.

+
+Release candidates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Before a new release or version of Ansible can be done, it will typically go
+through a release candidate process.
+
+This provides the Ansible community the opportunity to test Ansible and report
+bugs or issues they might come across.
+
+Ansible tags the first release candidate (``RC1``) which is usually scheduled
+to last five business days. The final release is done if no major bugs or
+issues are identified during this period.
+
+If there are major problems with the first candidate, a second candidate will
+be tagged (``RC2``) once the necessary fixes have landed.
+This second candidate lasts for a shorter duration than the first.
+If no problems have been reported after two business days, the final release is
+done.
+
+More release candidates can be tagged as required, so long as there are
+bugs that the Ansible core maintainers consider should be fixed before the
+final release.
+
+.. _freezing:
+
+Feature freeze
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+While there is a pending release candidate, the focus of core developers and
+maintainers will on fixes towards the release candidate.
+
+Merging new features or fixes that are not related to the release candidate may
+be delayed in order to allow the new release to be shipped as soon as possible.
