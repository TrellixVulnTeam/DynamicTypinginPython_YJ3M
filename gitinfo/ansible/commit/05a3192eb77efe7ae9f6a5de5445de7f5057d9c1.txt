 Introduction to ad-hoc commands
 *******************************
 
-An Ansible ad-hoc command uses the `/usr/bin/ansible` command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes. Ad-hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not re-usable. So why learn about ad-hoc commands first? Ad-hoc commands demonstrate the simplicity and power of Ansible. The concepts you learn here will port over directly to the playbook language. Before reading and executing these examples, please read :ref:`intro_inventory`.
