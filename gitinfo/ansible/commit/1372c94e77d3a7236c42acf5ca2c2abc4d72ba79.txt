-Module Repo Information
-=======================
-
-Hi!
-
-Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
-
-On September 26, 2014, due to enormous levels of contribution to the project Ansible decided to reorganize module repos, making it easier
-for developers to work on the project and for us to more easily manage new contributions and tickets.
-
-We split modules from the main project off into two repos, http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core and http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
-
-If you would still like this ticket attended to, we will need your help in having it reopened in one of the two new repos, and instructions are provided below.
-
-We apologize that we are not able to make this transition happen seamlessly, though this is a one-time change and your help is greatly appreciated -- 
-this will greatly improve velocity going forward.
-
-Both sets of modules will ship with Ansible, though they'll receive slightly different ticket handling.
-
-To locate where a module lives between 'core' and 'extras'
-
-   * Find the module at http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_all_modules.html
-   * Open the documentation page for that module
-   * If the bottom of the docs say "This is an extras module", submit your ticket to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
-   * Otherwise, submit your pull request to update the existing module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core
-   * action_plugins (modules with server side components) still live in the main repo.  If your ticket affects both, open the ticket
-     on the module repo just the same.
-
-Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:
-
-   * the ansible-project mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project
-
-Thank you very much!

-
-If you still would like this pull request merged, we will need your help making this target the new repo.  If you do not take any action, this
-pull request unfortunately cannot be applied.
-
-We apologize that we are not able to make this transition happen seamlessly, though this is a one-time change and your help is greatly appreciated --

-   * Otherwise, submit your pull request to update the existing module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core
-   * Note that python modules in ansible now also end in ".py" and this extension is required for new contributions.
-   * action_plugins (modules with server side components) still live in the main repo.  If your pull request touches both, which should be
-     exceedingly rare, submit two new pull requests and make sure to mention the links to each other in the comments.
-
-Otherwise, if this is a new module:
-
-   * Submit your pull request to add a module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
-
-It may be possible to re-patriate your pull requests automatically, one user-submitted approach for advanced git users
-has been suggested at https://gist.github.com/willthames/afbaaab0c9681ed45619

-Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:

-
-Thank you very much!

-Hi!
-
-Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
-
-This appears to be a submission about a module, and aside from action_plugins, if you know what those are, the modules
-in ansible are now moved to separate repos.  We would appreciate if you can submit this there instead.
-
-If this is about a new module, submit pull requests or ideas to:
-
-   * https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
-
-If this is about an existing module:
-
-   * Find the module at http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_all_modules.html
-   * Open the documentation page for that module
-   * If the bottom of the docs say "This is an extras module", submit your ticket to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
-   * Otherwise, submit your module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core
-
-Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:
-
-   * IRC: #ansible on irc.freenode.net
