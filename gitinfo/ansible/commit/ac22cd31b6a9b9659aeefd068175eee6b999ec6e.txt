    - The fundamental function of the module is to create, or delete lines in pg_hba files.

    - This module will sort resulting C(pg_hba) files if a rule change is required.
      This could give unexpected results with manual created hba files, if it was improperly sorted.
      For example a rule was created for a net first and for a ip in that net range next.
      In that situation, the 'ip specific rule' will never hit, it is in the C(pg_hba) file obsolete.
-     After the C(pg_hba) file is rewritten by the M(pg_hba) module, the ip specific rule will be sorted above the range rule.

      And then it will hit, which will give unexpected results.
    - With the 'order' parameter you can control which field is used to sort first, next and last.
    - The module supports a check mode and a diff mode.
