+   - MySQL server installs with default login_user of 'root' and no password. To secure this user
+     as part of an idempotent playbook, you must create at least two tasks: the first must change the root user's password,
+     without providing any login_user/login_password details. The second must drop a ~/.my.cnf file containing
+     the new root credentials. Subsequent runs of the playbook will then succeed by reading the new credentials from
+     the file.
