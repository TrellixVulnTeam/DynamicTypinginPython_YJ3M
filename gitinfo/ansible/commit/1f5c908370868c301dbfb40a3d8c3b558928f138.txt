+      - Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If I(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too.
+        If I(dest) is a nonexistent path and if either I(dest) ends with "/" or I(src) is a directory, I(dest) is created.
         If I(src) and I(dest) are files, then parent directory of I(dest) isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
