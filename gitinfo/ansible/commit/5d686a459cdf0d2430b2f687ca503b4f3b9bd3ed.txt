+pipelining
+==========
+
+Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to
+execute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer. 
+This can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled, however when using "sudo:" operations you must
+first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts.
+
+By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
+sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros), but is highly
+recommended if you can enable it, eliminating the need for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`::
+
+    pipelining=False

+   Are you running Ansible 1.5 or later?  If so, you may not need accelerate mode due to a new feature called "SSH pipelining"
+
+   For users on 1.5 and later, accelerate mode only makes sense if you are (A) are managing from an Enterprise Linux 6 or earlier host
+   and still are on paramiko, or (B) can't enable TTYs with sudo as described in the pipelining section of 
+   ref:`intro_configuration`.  
+
+   If you can use it, the pipelining feature in Ansible reduces the amount of files transferred over the wire, 
+   making everything much more efficient. If you can enable pipelining in ansible.cfg, it is
+   preferable to accelerate mode in most cases and requires fewer moving parts.  Accelerate mode remains around in support of EL6
+   control machines and other constrained environments.
+
 While OpenSSH using the ControlPersist feature is quite fast and scalable, there is a certain small amount of overhead involved in
 using SSH connections.  While many people will not encounter a need, if you are running on a platform that doesn't have ControlPersist support (such as an EL6 control machine), you'll probably be even more interested in tuning options.
