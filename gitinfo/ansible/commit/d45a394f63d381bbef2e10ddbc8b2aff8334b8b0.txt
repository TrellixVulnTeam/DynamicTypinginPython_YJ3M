 The rax module returns data about the nodes it creates, like IP addresses, hostnames, and login passwords.

This facilitates performing configuration actions on the hosts in a follow-on task.  In the following example, the servers that were successfully created using the above task are dynamically added to a group called "raxhosts", with each nodes hostname, IP address, and root password being added to the inventory.
