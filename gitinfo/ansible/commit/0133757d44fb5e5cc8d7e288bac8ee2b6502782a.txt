    Add an author exception for OpenStack Ansible SIG
    
    The current author line wants to match a github author id. But
    some people, including the OpenStack project, do not use github,
    and additionally do not claim individual ownership but instead
    group ownership.
    
    Since there are already a couple of hard-coded examples in the
    regex, just add one more. Alternately we could come up with some
    mechanism to indicate that the author is purposely not listing
    a github id, but that seems a bit heavywight.
