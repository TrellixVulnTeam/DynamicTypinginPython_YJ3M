+Hi!
+
+A change has been applied for this ticket, which should resolve this item for you.
+
+If you believe this ticket is not resolved, or have further questions, please let us know by stopping by one of the two mailing lists, as appropriate:
+
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project - for user questions, tips, and tricks
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for strategy, future planning, and questions about writing code
+
+Because this project is very active, we're unlikely to see comments on closed tickets, though the mailing list is a great way to get involved or discuss this one further.
+
+Thanks!
