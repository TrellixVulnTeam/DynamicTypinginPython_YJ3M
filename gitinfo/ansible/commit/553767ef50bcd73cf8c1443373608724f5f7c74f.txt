 Thank you very much for your submission to Ansible. It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken the time to contribute.
 
-Unfortunately, we're not sure if we want this feature in the program.
+Per recent announcements at AnsibleFest Atlanta 2019, going forward we are no longer accepting new one off modules/plugins, or modules/plugins that create a new category.
 
-However, we recommend looking into providing this functionality through Ansible Galaxy via Ansible Collections. You can find more information about collections at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/collections_tech_preview.html.
