 .. note:: Prior to version 1.9, Ansible mostly allowed the use of `sudo` and a limited use of `su` to allow a login/remote user to become a different user and execute tasks and create resources with the second user's permissions.

This new implementation also makes it easier to add other privilege escalation tools, including `pbrun` (Powerbroker), `pfexec`, `dzdo` (Centrify), and others.
