+module: include_role
+short_description: Load and execute a role
+description:
+     - "Loads and executes a role as a task, this frees roles from the `role:` directive and allows them to be treated more as tasks."
+version_added: "2.2"
+options:
+  name:
+    description:
+      - The name of the role to be executed.
+    required: True
+  tasks_from:
+    description:
+      - "File to load from a Role's tasks/ directory."
+    required: False
+    default: 'main'
+notes:
+    - THIS IS EARLY PREVIEW, THINGS MAY CHANGE
+    - Only basic roles have been tested for now, some things might not work as expected.
+    - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
+    - Currently role variables are not pushed up to the play.
+    - "Things not tested (yet): loops, plugin overrides, nesting includes, role dependencies, used as handler, other stuff I did not think of when I wrote this."
