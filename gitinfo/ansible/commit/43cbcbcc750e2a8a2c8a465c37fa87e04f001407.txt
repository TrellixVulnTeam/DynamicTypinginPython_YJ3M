+    description:
       - The dig lookup runs queries against DNS servers to retrieve DNS records for a specific name (FQDN - fully qualified domain name).
         It is possible to lookup any DNS record in this manner.
       - There is a couple of different syntaxes that can be used to specify what record should be retrieved, and for which name.
