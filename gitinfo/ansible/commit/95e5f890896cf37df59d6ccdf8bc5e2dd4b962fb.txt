    Clarify source of the host name (#54693)
    
    The host could have been either the inventory name (`inventory_hostname`)
    or the discovered hostname (`ansible_hostname`)
    
    Inspecting the source code of `fetch.py` shows that the
    inventory name is preferred.
    
    ```
    if 'inventory_hostname' in task_vars:
                        target_name = task_vars['inventory_hostname']
    ```
