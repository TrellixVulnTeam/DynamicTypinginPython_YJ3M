+==========
+
+.. version_added: '1.4'
+
+The roles path indicate additional directories beyond the 'roles/' subdirectory of a playbook project to search to find Ansible
+roles.  For instance, if there was a source control repository of common roles and a different repository of playbooks, you might
+choose to establish a convention to checkout roles in /opt/mysite/roles like so::
+
+    roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles
+
+Roles will be first searched for in the playbook directory.  Should a role not be found, it will indicate all the possible paths
+that were searched.
