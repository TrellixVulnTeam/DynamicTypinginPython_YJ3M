commit 5159457ba16284e4ca2e0dccf4e0499b9d238597
Author: Matt Clay <matt@mystile.com>

    Fix ansible-test unit test requirements.
    
    Requirements were incorrectly added to ansible-test in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/61813
    
    These requirements should have been placed into `test/units/requirements.txt` instead.
    Now that the relevant content has been migrated out of the repository, the requirements are no longer necessary there either.
    
    No changelog entry for this change since the original changes were not included in any release and also lacked a changelog entry.
