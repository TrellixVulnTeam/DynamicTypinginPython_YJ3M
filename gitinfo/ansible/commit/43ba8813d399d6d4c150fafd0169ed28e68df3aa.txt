    Move summary to be next to where github places the commit message. (#22368)
    
    If a user makes a PR with a single, detailed commit message, github will
    put that at the top of the PR.  Move our summary field to the top of
    the PR template so that it is next to where the commit message is
    placed.  Users can then easily merge the two together or supplement the
    commit message with additional information that we ask for.
