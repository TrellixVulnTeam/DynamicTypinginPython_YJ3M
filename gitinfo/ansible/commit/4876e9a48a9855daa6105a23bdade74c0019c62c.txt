    specify basic minimum botocore version for this module (#52417)
    
    Bump the version and give a warning. It took me 30+ mins to carefully look through botocore to find the minimum version. Grumble.
    Fixes #52393, partially helps #39085.
    
    * Update lib/ansible/modules/cloud/amazon/cloudformation.py

      - Launches or updates an AWS CloudFormation stack and waits for it complete.
 notes:
-     - As of version 2.3, migrated to boto3 to enable new features. To match existing behavior, YAML parsing is done in the module, not given to AWS as YAML.
-       This will change (in fact, it may change before 2.3 is out).
+     - Cloudformation features change often, and this module tries to keep up. That means your botocore version should be fresh.
+       The version listed in the requirements is the oldest version that works with the module as a whole.
+       Some features may require recent versions, and we do not pinpoint a minimum version for each feature.
+       Instead of relying on the minimum version, keep botocore up to date. AWS is always releasing features and fixing bugs.
