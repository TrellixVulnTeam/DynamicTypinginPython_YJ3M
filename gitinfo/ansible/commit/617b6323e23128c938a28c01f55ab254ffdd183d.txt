 Included modules will ship with ansible, and also have a change to be promoted to 'core' status, which
 gives them slightly higher development priority (though they'll work in exactly the same way).

+Deprecating and makingm module aliases
+``````````````````````````````````````
+
+Starting in 1.8 you can deprecate modules by renaming them with a preceeding _, i.e. old_cloud.py to 
+_old_cloud.py, This will keep the module available but hide it from the primary docs and listing.
+
+You can also rename modules and keep an alias to the old name by using a symlink that starts with _.
+This example allows the stat module to be called with fileinfo, making the following examples equivalent
+
+    EXAMPLES = '''
+    ln -s stat.py _fileinfo.py
+    ansible -m stat -a "path=/tmp" localhost
+    ansible -m fileinfo -a "path=/tmp" localhost
+    '''
