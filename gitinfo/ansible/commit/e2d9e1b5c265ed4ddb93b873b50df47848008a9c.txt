+'Hacking' directory tools
+=========================
+
+Env-setup
+---------
+
+The 'env-setup' script modifies your environment to allow you to run
+ansible from a git checkout using python 2.6+.  (You may not use
+python 3 at this time).
+
+First, set up your environment to run from the checkout:
+
+    $ source ./hacking/env-setup
+
+You will need some basic prerequisites installed.  If you do not already have them
+and do not wish to install them from your operating system package manager, you
+can install them from pip
+
+    $ easy_install pip               # if pip is not already available
+    $ pip install pyyaml jinja2
+
+From there, follow ansible instructions on ansible.cc/docs as normal.
+
+Module-formatter
+----------------
+
+The module formatter is a script used to generate manpages and online
+module documentation.
+
+Authors
+-------
+
+'authors' is a simple script that generates a list of everyone who has
+contributed code to the ansible repository.
+
+Test-module
+-----------
+
+'test-module' is a simple program that allows module developers (or testers) to run
+a module outside of the ansible program, locally, on the current machine.
+
+Example:
+
+    $ ./hacking/test-module -m library/shell -a "echo hi"
+
+This is a good way to insert a breakpoint into a module, for instance.
