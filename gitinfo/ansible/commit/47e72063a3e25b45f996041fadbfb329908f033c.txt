commit 47e72063a3e25b45f996041fadbfb329908f033c
Author: Richlv <richlv@nakts.net>

    Update zabbix_action.py (#50149)
    
    Mostly typo/grammar fixes. "Zabbix Server" was changed to just "Zabbix", as it could be slightly confusing - some people might interpret this referencing the server process, although API matters. "capital-case" was changed, as it usually is one of "capital" or "upper-case".
