    Set license GPLv3+ ("or any later version") in setup.py
    
    Most file headers in the project contain the standard
    > either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22any+later+version%22
    
    So this project appears to be GPLv3+, as stated in the classifiers function.
