    vmware_guest_network/test: disable the test
    
    The test fails in the CI with a timeout of vmware_guest_tools_wait. It's
    still unclear if this comes from:
    
    - the ESXi environment
    - the VM configuration, e.g: the amount of the RAM
    - the ISO image itself
    
    Ideally, we should have a light VM with the vmware-tools.
