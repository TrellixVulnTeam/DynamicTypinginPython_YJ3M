    Added tests for the guts of the program (Runner()) and modules.  Idea is to run
    everything as the logged in user using local checkout and write to a tempdir.
    To run tests, be sure user is in SSH authorized_keys for themselves, this DOES
    run through paramiko because mocking it out would defeat the point of having tests.
