   by setting the `ANSIBLE_NULL_REPRESENTATION` environment variable.
 * Added `meta: refresh_inventory` to force rereading the inventory in a play.
   This re-executes inventory scripts, but does not force them to ignore any cache they might use.
-* Now when you delegate an action that returns ansible_facts, these facts will be applied to the delegated host, unlike before when they were applied to the current host.
+* New delegate_facts directive, a boolean that allows you to apply facts to the delegated host (true/yes) instead of the inventory_hostname (no/false) which is the default and previous behaviour.
 * local connections now work with 'su' as a privilege escalation method
 * New ssh configuration variables(`ansible_ssh_common_args`, `ansible_ssh_extra_args`) can be used to configure a
   per-group or per-host ssh ProxyCommand or set any other ssh options.
