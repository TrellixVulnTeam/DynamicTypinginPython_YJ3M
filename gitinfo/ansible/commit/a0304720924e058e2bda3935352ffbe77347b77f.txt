 Both users and developers should look into the new plugins because they are intended to alleviate the need for many of the hacks and workarounds found in the dynamic inventory scripts.

+* Callbacks are now using the new configuration system.  Users should not need to change anything as the old system still works,

+Developers:
+
+* If your callback does not inherit from ``CallbackBase`` (directly or indirectly via another callback), it will still work, but issue a deprecation notice.
+  To avoid this and ensure it works in the future change it to inherit from ``callbackBase`` so it has the new options handling methods and properties.
+  You can also implement the new options handling methods and properties but that won't automatically inherit changes added in the future.  You can look at ``CallbackBase`` itself and/or ``AnsiblePlugin`` for details.
+* Any callbacks inheriting from other callbacks might need to also be updated to contain the same documented options
+  as the parent or the options won't be available.  This is noted in the developer guide.

 The configuration system has had some major changes. Users should be unaffected except for the following:
 
- * All relative paths defined are relative to the `ansible.cfg` file itself. Previously they varied by setting. The new behavior should be more predictable.
- * A new macro ``{{CWD}}`` is available for paths, which will make paths relative to the 'current working directory',

 Developers that were working directly with the previous API should revisit their usage as some methods (for example, ``get_config``) were  kept for backwards compatibility but will warn users that the function has been deprecated.
