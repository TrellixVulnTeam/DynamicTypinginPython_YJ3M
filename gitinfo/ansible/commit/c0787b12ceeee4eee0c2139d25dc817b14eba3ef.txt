    system/ufw.py: Add security warning re. removing ufw application profâ€¦
    
    It's not particularly obvious that removing an application will remove it
    from ufw's own state, potentially leaving ports open on your box if you
    upload your configuration.
    
    Whilst this applies to a lot of things in Ansible, firewall rules might
    cross some sort of line that justifies such a warning in his instance.
