 Playbooks
 =========
 
-Playbooks are loosely equivalent to recipes or manifests in most configuration
-management or deployment tools and describe a set of operations to run on
-a set of hosts.  Some tasks can choose to only fire when certain
-conditions are true, and if a task in a chain fails the dependent tasks
-will not proceed.  Playbooks are described in (YAML)[http://yaml.org] format.
+Playbooks are particularly awesome.  Playbooks can batch ansible commands
+together, and run some commands only when ansible modifies certain higher
+level resources -- such as restarting apache when a configuration file is 
+replaced.  They generate detailed reports of what happend on each node.
+
+See examples/playbook.yml for what the syntax looks like.
+
+To run a playbook:
+
+ansible -r playbook.yml
+
+An ansible-playbook CLI command is pending.  Until then, remember that when
+using playbooks, the pattern and host list options come from the playbook
+and are ignored.  Other options still apply.
