    Correct doc about the Git module verify_commit param
    
    All that is required to verify the signature is that the matching
    public key is present in the remote user's keyring. There is no need
    for GnuPG to explicitly trust the authenticity of the key.
    
    Not Ansible specific, but rather the behavior of the `git verify-commit`
    and the `git verify-tag` command line invocations.
