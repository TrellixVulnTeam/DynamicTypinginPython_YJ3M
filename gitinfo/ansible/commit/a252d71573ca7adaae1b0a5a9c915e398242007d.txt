    Update developing_modules.rst (#18646)
    
    I was wondering how to return a new fact from a module I got the answer on IRC thx to "mgedmin".
    I read this doc several time but didn't understood that I had to return a "ansible_facts" in the module.exit_json.
    This change is about showing a sample code of it to help the next reader ;)

 These 'facts' will be available to all statements called after that module (but not before) in the playbook.
