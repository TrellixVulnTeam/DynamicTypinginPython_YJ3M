    add comment: ports need to be exposed.
    
    port mapping with this module only works for ports that are exposed either in the Dockerfile or via an additional arguments. This is different from the command line docker client, that is willing to also map ports that are not exposed.
    
    This comments makes the behaviour more obvious.
