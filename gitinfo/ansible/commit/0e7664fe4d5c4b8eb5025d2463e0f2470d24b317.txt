 ###Deprecations:
 * Specifying --tags (or --skip-tags) multiple times on the command line
-  currently leads to the last one overridding all the previous ones.  This
-  behaviour is deprecated.  In the future, if you specify --tags multiple times
-  the tags will be merged together.  In 2.3, using --tags multiple times on one
-  command line will emit a deprecation warning.  Setting the
-  merge_multiple_cli_tags option to True in the ansible.cfg file will enable
-  the new behaviour.  In 2.4, the default will be to merge and you can enable
-  the old overwriting behaviour via the config option.  In 2.5, multiple --tags
-  options will be merged with no way to go back to the old behaviour.
