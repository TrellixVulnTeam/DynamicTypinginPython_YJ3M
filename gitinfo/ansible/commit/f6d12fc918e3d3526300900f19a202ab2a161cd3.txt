-  Connection plugins have been standardized to allow use of ``ansible_<conn-type>_user``
-  and ``ansible_<conn-type>_password`` variables.  Variables such as
-  ``ansible_<conn-type>_pass`` and ``ansible_<conn-type>_username`` are treated
-  with lower priority than the standardized names and may be deprecated in the
-  future.  In general, the ``ansible_user`` and ``ansible_password`` vars should
-  be used unless there is a reason to use the connection-specific variables.
