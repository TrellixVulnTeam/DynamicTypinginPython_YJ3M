    rewrite file's 'dest' argument
    
    Previously, there were two entries for 'dest'. I've combined them in a
    way that makes sense to me.
    
    This will be superfluous when 'path' is made. Ideally, I'd like to see
    'path' have the bulk of the definition, and 'dest' to be an alias to
    'path'.
