    Possible docs error: 'path' instead of 'src'
    
    I came to this example today (line 50), and when I tried it, I got an error:
    
    `msg: src and dest are required for creating links`
    
    So, I changed **path** to **src** and it worked fine. Looks like the example is wrong, since the docs say "dest" is already an alias for "path", in which case we would have 2 "path" definitions.
