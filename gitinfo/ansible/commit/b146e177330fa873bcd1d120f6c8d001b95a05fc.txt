 Workflow
 --------
 
-The triage bot runs every six hours and examines every open PR in both
-core and extras repositories, and enforces state roughly according to
-the following workflow:
-
--  If a PR has no workflow labels, it’s considered “new”. Files in the
-   PR are identified, and the maintainers of those files are pinged by
-   the bot, along with instructions on how to review the PR. (Note:
-   sometimes we strip labels from a PR to “reboot” this process.)
--  If the module maintainer is not “ansible”, the PR then goes into the
-   “community\_review” state.
--  If the module maintainer is “ansible”, the PR then goes into the
-   “core\_review” state (and probably sits for a while).
--  If the PR is in “community\_review” and has received comments from
-   the maintainer:
--  If the maintainer says “shipit”, the PR is labeled “shipit”,
-   whereupon the Core team assesses it for final merge.
--  If the maintainer says “needs\_info”, the PR is labeled “needs\_info”
-   and the submitter is asked for more info.
--  If the maintainer says “needs\_revision”, the PR is labeled
-   “needs\_revision” and the submitter is asked to fix some things.
--  If the PR is in “needs\_revision/needs\_info” and has received
-   comments from the submitter:
--  If the submitter says “ready\_for\_review”, the PR is put back into
-   community\_review/core\_review and the maintainer is notified that
-   the PR is ready to be reviewed again.
--  If the PR is in “needs\_revision/needs\_info” and the submitter has
-   not responded lately:
--  The submitter is first politely pinged after two weeks, pinged again
-   after two more weeks and labeled “pending action”, and then may be
-   closed two weeks after that.
--  If the submitter responds at all, the clock is reset.
--  If the PR is in “community\_review” and the reviewer has not
-   responded lately:
--  The reviewer is first politely pinged after two weeks, pinged again
-   after two more weeks and labeled “pending\_action”, and then may be
-   reassigned to “ansible” / core\_review, or often the submitter of the
-   PR is asked to step up as a maintainer.
--  If Travis fails, or if the code is not mergable, the PR is
-   automatically put into “needs\_revision” along with a message to the
-   submitter explaining why.

 Once you've learned about the development process and have contributed code to a particular module, we encourage you to become a maintainer of that module. There are hundreds of different modules in Ansible, and the vast majority of them are written and maintained entirely by members of the Ansible community.
