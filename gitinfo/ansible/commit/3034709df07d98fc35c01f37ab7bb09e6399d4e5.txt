commit 3034709df07d98fc35c01f37ab7bb09e6399d4e5
Author: Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>

    Improve GitHub templates (#44455)
    
    * Improve GitHub templates
    
    The existing templates are basically a copy for each type of issue (bug,
    feature, doc) whereas we can make the template more specific to the task
    at hand.
    
    This PR includes:
    - More specific sections depending on the type of issue
    - More concise and direct instructions (NO NEED FOR FRUSTRATION CAPS!)
    - Single-line comments (no need to guide people to avoid wrong edits)
    - Improved paste area
    - Better headings/titles
    - No 'Summary' title for PRs (so commit information is placed correctly)
    
    This PR would require some improvements to Ansibot.
    
    * Remove controversial Ansibot stuff
    
    Make it easier to get the first batch merged.
    
    * Restore ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
    
    * Incorporate reviewer suggestions
    
    * Make OS / ENVIRONMENT doc-related
    
    * Rephrase Ansibot-related message
