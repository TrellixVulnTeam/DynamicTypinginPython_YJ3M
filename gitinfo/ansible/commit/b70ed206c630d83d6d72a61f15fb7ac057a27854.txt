    needed due to moving into packaging/debian?

+I have added a debian folder for use in building a .deb file for ansible. From the ansible directory you can run the following command to construct a debian package of ansible.
+
+~/ansible$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot
+
+The debian package files will be placed in the ../ directory and can be installed with the following command:
+~/$ sudo dpkg -i .deb
+
+Dpkg -i doesn't resolve dependencies, so if the previous command fails because of dependencies, you will need to run the following to install the dependencies (if needed) and then re-run the dpkg -i command to install the package:
+$ sudo apt-get -f install
