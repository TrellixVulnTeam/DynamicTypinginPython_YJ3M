    Removing colon from example failure message
    
    The example failure message was given as - fail: msg="Bailing out: this play requires 'bar'"
    
    The colon in the example causes a YAML compile error, so I am replacing it with a '.'

 This is especially useful in combination with the conditional import of vars
