 ansible-modules-core
 ====================
 
-This repo is transitional and not yet enabled.  Do not send issues or pull requests here yet.
+This repo contains Ansible's most popular modules that are shipped with Ansible.
 
-The goal is to split library/ from ansible into git submodules. 
+New module submissions for modules that do not yet exist should be submitted to ansible-modules-extras, rather than this repo.
 
-See details:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/W2FYdXZ7zlM
-
-Once complete, core modules will be manually promoted from new submissions to extras.  New modules must be submitted first to extras, and tickets should be opened in the appropriate repo (ansible/ansible, ansible/ansible-modules-core, or ansible/ansible-modules-extras).
+Take care to submit tickets to the appropriate repo where modules are contained.  The docs.ansible.com website indicates this at the bottom of each module documentation page.
