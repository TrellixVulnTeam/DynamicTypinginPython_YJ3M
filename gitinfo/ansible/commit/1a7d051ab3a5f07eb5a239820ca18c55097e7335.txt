 * Changed the `user:` parameter on plays to `remote_user:` to prevent confusion with the module of the same name.  Still backwards compatible on play parameters.

 * Inventory hosts are used in the order they appear in the inventory.
 * in hosts: foo[2-5] type syntax, the iterators now are zero indexed and the last index is non-inclusive, to match Python standards.
+* There's now a way for a callback plugin to disable itself.  See osx_say example code for an example.
+* Many bugfixes to modules of all types.
+* Complex arguments now can be used with async tasks
+* SSH ControlPath is now configurable in ansible.cfg.  There's a limit to the lengths of these paths, see how to shorten them in ansible.cfg.
+* md5sum support on AIX with csum.

+* Added 'append_privs' option to the mysql_user module
+* Can now update (temporarily change) host variables using the "add_host" module for existing hosts.
+* Fixes for IPv6 addresses in inventory text files
