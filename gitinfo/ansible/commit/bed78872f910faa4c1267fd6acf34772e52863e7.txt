    Synchronize: Document the private_key option (#32754)
    
    `synchronize` has supported the `private_key` option for a long time,
    apparently. But for some reason it was never documented.
    
    Today I managed to workaround the synchronize quoting bug by just using
    
    ```
    private_key: /path/to/id_rsa
    ```
    
    instead of
    
    ```
    rsync_opts:
      - "--rsh 'ssh -i /path/to/id_rsa'"
    ```
    
    So, I'll just go ahead and document this useful option ...

 notes:
    - rsync must be installed on both the local and remote host.
    - For the C(synchronize) module, the "local host" is the host `the synchronize task originates on`, and the "destination host" is the host
