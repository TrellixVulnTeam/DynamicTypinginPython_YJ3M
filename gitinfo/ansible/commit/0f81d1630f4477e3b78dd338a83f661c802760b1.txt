 Once your nodes are spun up, you'll probably want to talk to them again.  The best way to handle his is to use the ec2 inventory plugin.
 
-Even for larger environments, you might have nodes spun up from Cloud Formations or other tooling.  You don't have to use Ansible to spin up guests.  Once these are created and you wish to configure them, the EC2 API can be used to return system grouping with the help of the EC2 inventory script.

 For some the delay between refreshing host information and acting on that host information (i.e. running Ansible tasks against the hosts) may be too long. This may be the case in such scenarios where EC2 AutoScaling is being used to scale the number of instances as a result of a particular event. Such an event may require that hosts come online and are configured as soon as possible (even a 1 minute delay may be undesirable).  Its possible to pre-bake machine images which contain the necessary ansible-pull script and components to pull and run a playbook via git. The machine images could be configured to run ansible-pull upon boot as part of the bootstrapping procedure.
