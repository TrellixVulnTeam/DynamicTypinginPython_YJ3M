 - **Too many consecutive API calls may result in connection throttling**
 
-  Starting with ACI v3.1 the APIC will actively throttle password-based authenticated connection rates over a specific treshold. This is as part of an anti-DDOS measure but can act up when using Ansible with ACI using password-based authentication. Currently, one solution is to increase this treshold within the nginx configuration, but it is advisable to use signature-based authentication as this also improves performance in general.
