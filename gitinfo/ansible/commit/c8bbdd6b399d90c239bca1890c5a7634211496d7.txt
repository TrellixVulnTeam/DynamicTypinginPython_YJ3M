commit c8bbdd6b399d90c239bca1890c5a7634211496d7
Author: James Cammarata <jimi@sngx.net>

    Don't assign both parent blocks and task includes to blocks
    
    This causes problems when fetching parent attributes, as the include
    was being skipped because the parent block would fetch the attribute
    from the parent play first.
    
    Fixes #13872
