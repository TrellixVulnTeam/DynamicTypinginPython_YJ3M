    Add note about sefcontext doing no restorecon (#39076)
    
    * Add note about sefcontext doing no restorecon
    
    To someone like me who is relatively new to SELinux, setting the
    "reload" option to yes might suggest that a restorecon is automatically
    executed after the semanage call, making the new file context effective
    immediately. I have found out that this is not the case and would like
    to clarify this to others.

    * Replace note by one suggested by reviewer
    
    Reviewer dagwieers suggested a better notice text during review of my
    original one, giving recommendations about what to do to actually get
    the newly chosen SELinux context applied to the file.

 notes:
 - The changes are persistent across reboots
+- The M(sefcontext) module does not modify existing files to the new
+  SELinux context(s), so it is advisable to first create the SELinux
+  file contexts before creating files, or run C(restorecon) manually
+  for the existing files that require the new SELinux file contexts.
 requirements:
 - libselinux-python
 - policycoreutils-python
