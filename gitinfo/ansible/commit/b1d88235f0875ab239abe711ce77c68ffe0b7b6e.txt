 # There is actually no actual shell module source, when you use 'shell' in ansible,

+module: shell
+short_description: Execute commands in nodes.
+description:
+     - The shell module takes the command name followed by a list of arguments, space delimited. It is almost exactly like the command module but runs the command through the user's configured shell on the remote node.
+version_added: "0.0.2"
+options:
+  (free form):
+    description:
+      - The command module takes a free form command to run
+    required: null
+    default: null
+  creates:
+    description:
+      - a filename, when it already exists, this step will NOT be run
+    required: false
+    default: null
+  chdir:
+    description:
+      - cd into this directory before running the command (0.6 and later)
+    required: false
+    default: null
+examples:
+   - code: shell somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
+     description: Execute the command in remote shell
+notes:
+   -  If you want to execute a command securely and predicably, it may be better to use the 'command' module instead. Best practices when writing playbooks will follow the trend of using M(command) unless M(shell) is explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best judgement.
