-For Python-3 we are currently using Python-3.4 as a minimum.  However, no long
-term supported Linux distributions currently ship with Python-3.  When that
-occurs, we will probably take that as our minimum Python-3 version rather than
-Python-3.4.  Thus far, Python-3 has been adding small changes that make it
-more compatible with Python-2 in its newer versions (For instance, Python-3.5
-added the ability to use percent-formatted byte strings.) so it should be more
-pleasant to use a newer version of Python-3 if it's available.  At some point
-this will change but we'll just have to cross that bridge when we get to it.
-
-For Python-2 the default is for modules to run on Python-2.4.  This allows
-users with older distributions that are stuck on Python-2.4 to manage their
-machines.  Modules are allowed to drop support for Python-2.4 when one of
-their dependent libraries require a higher version of python.  This is not an
-invitation to add unnecessary dependent libraries in order to force your
-module to be usable only with a newer version of Python.  Instead it is an
-acknowledgment that some libraries (for instance, boto3 and docker-py) will
-only function with newer Python.
+For Python-3 we are currently using Python-3.5 as a minimum on both the
+controller and the managed nodes.  This was chosen as it's the version of
+Python3 in Ubuntu-16.04, the first long-term support (LTS) distribution to
+ship with Python3 and not Python2.  Much of our code would still work with
+Python-3.4 but there are always bugfixes and new features in any new upstream
+release.  Taking advantage of this relatively new version allows us not to
+worry about workarounds for problems and missing features in that older
+version.
+
+For Python-2, the default is for the controller to run on Python-2.6 and
+modules to run on Python-2.4.  This allows users with older distributions that
+are stuck on Python-2.4 to manage their machines.  Modules are allowed to drop
+support for Python-2.4 when one of their dependent libraries require a higher
+version of python.  This is not an invitation to add unnecessary dependent
+libraries in order to force your module to be usable only with a newer version
+of Python.  Instead it is an acknowledgment that some libraries (for instance,
+boto3 and docker-py) will only function with newer Python.
 
 .. note:: When will we drop support for Python-2.4?
 
     The only long term supported distro that we know of with Python-2.4 is
-    RHEL5 (and its rebuilds like CentOS5)  which is supported until April of
-    2017.  We will likely end our support for Python-2.4 in modules in an
-    Ansible release around that time.  We know of no long term supported
-    distributions with Python-2.5 so the new minimum Python-2 version will
-    likely be Python-2.6.  This will let us take advantage of the
-    forwards-compat features of Python-2.6 so porting and maintainance of
-    Python-2/Python-3 code will be easier after that.
