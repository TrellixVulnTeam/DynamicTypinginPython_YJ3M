    leftover from porting become to v2 that's unused
    
    The set_become_default() function is not needed.  All this time, if it
    was called it would try to set a value on a passed by value variable
    (meaning that it had no effect after returning to the caller).  Since
    become has been working in v2, this code is not needed.  Removing.
