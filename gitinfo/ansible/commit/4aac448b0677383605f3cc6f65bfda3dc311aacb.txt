    Adds AUR link for Arch build
    
    Adds URL to AUR ansile page
    Adds suggestion to symlink python to python2 since most Arch users have
    python3 by default. This suggestion might not be wise, though it doesn't
    seem to break anything.
    It might be probably wiser to have a patch for the AUR build that takes
    care of this.
