-Beyond Playbooks: Moving Tasks and Variables into Roles
-================================================================================
 
-Roles are sets of Ansible defaults, files, tasks, templates, variables, and other Ansible components that work together. As you saw on the Working with Playbooks page, moving from a command to a playbook makes it easy to run multiple tasks and repeat the same tasks in the same order. Moving from a playbook to a role makes it even easier to reuse and share your ordered tasks. For more details, see the :doc:`documentation on roles<../../user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles>`. You can also look at :doc:`Ansible Galaxy<../../reference_appendices/galaxy>`, which lets you share your roles and use others' roles, either directly or as inspiration.

 As you expand your inventory, roles and playbooks, you should place your Ansible projects under source control. We recommend ``git`` for source control. ``git`` provides an audit trail, letting you track changes, roll back mistakes, view history and share the workload of managing, maintaining and expanding your Ansible ecosystem. There are plenty of tutorials and guides to using ``git`` available.

+*************************
+Use Ansible network roles
+*************************
+
+Roles are sets of Ansible defaults, files, tasks, templates, variables, and other Ansible components that work together. As you saw on :ref:`first_network_playbook`, moving from a command to a playbook makes it easy to run multiple tasks and repeat the same tasks in the same order.

You can look at :ref:`Ansible Galaxy <ansible_galaxy>`, which lets you share your roles and use others' roles, either directly or as inspiration.

+
+Understanding roles
+===================
+
+So what exactly is a role, and why should you care? Ansible roles are basically playbooks broken up into a known file structure. Moving to roles from a playbook makes sharing, reading, and updating your Ansible workflow easier. Users can write their own roles. So for example, you don't have to write your own DNS playbook. Instead, you specify a DNS server and a role to configure it for you.
+
+To simplify your workflow even further, the Ansible Network team has written a series of roles for common network use cases. Using these roles means you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Instead of writing and maintaining your own ``create_vlan`` playbooks or roles, you can concentrate on designing, codifying and maintaining the parser templates that describe your network topologies and inventory, and let Ansible's network roles do the work. See the `network-related roles <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network>`_ on Ansible Galaxy.
+
+A sample DNS playbook
+---------------------
+
+To demonstrate the concept of what a role is, the example ``playbook.yml`` below is a single YAML file containing a two-task playbook.  This Ansible Playbook configures the hostname on a Cisco IOS XE device, then it configures the DNS (domain name system) servers.
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+   ---
+   - name: configure cisco routers
+     hosts: routers
+     connection: network_cli
+     gather_facts: no
+     vars:
+       dns: "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
+
+     tasks:
+      - name: configure hostname
+        ios_config:
+          lines: hostname {{ inventory_hostname }}
+
+      - name: configure DNS
+        ios_config:
+          lines: ip name-server {{dns}}
+
+If you run this playbook using the ``ansible-playbook`` command, you'll see the output below.  This example used ``-l`` option to limit the playbook to only executing on the **rtr1** node.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -l rtr1
+
+   PLAY [configure cisco routers] *************************************************
+
+   TASK [configure hostname] ******************************************************
+   changed: [rtr1]
+
+   TASK [configure DNS] ***********************************************************
+   changed: [rtr1]
+
+   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
+   rtr1                       : ok=2    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
+
+
+This playbook configured the hostname and DNS servers.  You can verify that configuration on the Cisco IOS XE **rtr1** router:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   rtr1#sh run | i name
+   hostname rtr1
+   ip name-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
+
+Convert the playbook into a role
+---------------------------------
+
+The next step is to convert this playbook into a reusable role. You can create the directory structure manually, or you can use ``ansible-galaxy init`` to create the standard framework for a role.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible ~]$ ansible-galaxy init system-demo
+   [user@ansible ~]$ cd system-demo/
+   [user@ansible system-demo]$ tree
+   .
+   ├── defaults
+   │   └── main.yml
+   ├── files
+   ├── handlers
+   │   └── main.yml
+   ├── meta
+   │   └── main.yml
+   ├── README.md
+   ├── tasks
+   │   └── main.yml
+   ├── templates
+   ├── tests
+   │   ├── inventory
+   │   └── test.yml
+   └── vars
+     └── main.yml
+
+This first demonstration uses only the **tasks** and **vars** directories.  The directory structure would look as follows:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible system-demo]$ tree
+   .
+   ├── tasks
+   │   └── main.yml
+   └── vars
+       └── main.yml
+
+Next, move the content of the ``vars`` and ``tasks`` sections from the original Ansible Playbook into the role. First, move the two tasks into the ``tasks/main.yml`` file:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible system-demo]$ cat tasks/main.yml
+   ---
+   - name: configure hostname
+     ios_config:
+       lines: hostname {{ inventory_hostname }}
+
+   - name: configure DNS
+     ios_config:
+       lines: ip name-server {{dns}}
+
+Next, move the variables into the ``vars/main.yml`` file:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible system-demo]$ cat vars/main.yml
+   ---
+   dns: "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
+
+Finally, modify the original Ansible Playbook to remove the ``tasks`` and ``vars`` sections and add the keyword ``roles``  with the name of the role, in this case ``system-demo``.  You'll have this playbook:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+   ---
+   - name: configure cisco routers
+     hosts: routers
+     connection: network_cli
+     gather_facts: no
+
+     roles:
+       - system-demo
+
+To summarize, this demonstration now has a total of three directories and three YAML files.  There is the ``system-demo`` folder, which represents the role.  This ``system-demo`` contains two folders, ``tasks`` and ``vars``.  There is a ``main.yml`` is each respective folder.  The ``vars/main.yml`` contains the variables from ``playbook.yml``.  The ``tasks/main.yml`` contains the tasks from ``playbook.yml``.  The ``playbook.yml`` file has been modified to call the role rather than specifying vars and tasks directly.  Here is a tree of the current working directory:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible ~]$ tree
+   .
+   ├── playbook.yml
+   └── system-demo
+       ├── tasks
+       │   └── main.yml
+       └── vars
+           └── main.yml
+
+Running the playbook results in identical behavior with slightly different output:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -l rtr1
+
+   PLAY [configure cisco routers] *************************************************
+
+   TASK [system-demo : configure hostname] ****************************************
+   ok: [rtr1]
+
+   TASK [system-demo : configure DNS] *********************************************
+   ok: [rtr1]
+
+   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
+   rtr1             : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
+
+As seen above each task is now prepended with the role name, in this case ``system-demo``.  When running a playbook that contains several roles, this will help pinpoint where a task is being called from.  This playbook returned ``ok`` instead of ``changed`` because it has identical behavior for the single file playbook we started from.
+
+As before, the playbook will generate the following configuration on a Cisco IOS-XE router:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   rtr1#sh run | i name
+   hostname rtr1
+   ip name-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
+
+
+This is why Ansible roles can be simply thought of as deconstructed playbooks. They are simple, effective and reusable.  Now another user can simply include the ``system-demo`` role instead of having to create a custom "hard coded" playbook.
+
+Variable precedence
+-------------------
+
+What if you want to change the DNS servers?  You aren't expected to change the ``vars/main.yml`` within the role structure. Ansible has many places where you can specify variables for a given play. See :ref:`playbooks_variables` for details on variables and precedence. There are actually 21 places to put variables.  While this list can seem overwhelming at first glance, the vast majority of use cases only involve knowing the spot for variables of least precedence and how to pass variables with most precedence. See :ref:`ansible_variable_precedence` for more guidance on where you should put variables.
+
+Lowest precedence
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The lowest precedence is the ``defaults`` directory within a role.  This means all the other 20 locations you could potentially specify the variable will all take higher precedence than ``defaults``, no matter what.  To immediately give the vars from the ``system-demo`` role the least precedence, rename the ``vars`` directory to ``defaults``.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible system-demo]$ mv vars defaults
+   [user@ansible system-demo]$ tree
+   .
+   ├── defaults
+   │   └── main.yml
+   ├── tasks
+   │   └── main.yml
+
+Add a new ``vars`` section to the playbook to override the default behavior (where the variable ``dns`` is set to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).  For this demonstration, set ``dns`` to 1.1.1.1, so ``playbook.yml`` becomes:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+   ---
+   - name: configure cisco routers
+     hosts: routers
+     connection: network_cli
+     gather_facts: no
+     vars:
+       dns: 1.1.1.1
+     roles:
+       - system-demo
+
+Run this updated playbook on **rtr2**:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -l rtr2
+
+The configuration on the **rtr2** Cisco router will look as follows:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   rtr2#sh run | i name-server
+   ip name-server 1.1.1.1
+
+The variable configured in the playbook now has precedence over the ``defaults`` directory.  In fact, any other spot you configure variables would win over the values in the ``defaults`` directory.
+
+Highest precedence
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Specifying variables in the ``defaults`` directory within a role will always take the lowest precedence, while specifying ``vars`` as extra vars with the ``-e`` or ``--extra-vars=`` will always take the highest precedence, no matter what.  Re-running the playbook with the ``-e`` option overrides both the ``defaults`` directory (8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8) as well as the newly created ``vars`` within the playbook that contains the 1.1.1.1 dns server.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "dns=192.168.1.1" -l rtr3
+
+The result on the Cisco IOS XE router will only contain the highest precedence setting of 192.168.1.1:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   rtr3#sh run | i name-server
+   ip name-server 192.168.1.1
+
+How is this useful?  Why should you care?  Extra vars are commonly used by network operators to override defaults.  A powerful example of this is with Red Hat Ansible Tower and the Survey feature.  It is possible through the web UI to prompt a network operator to fill out parameters with a Web form.  This can be really simple for non-technical playbook writers to execute a playbook using their Web browser. See `Ansible Tower Job Template Surveys <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html#surveys>`_ for more details.
+
+
+Ansible supported network roles
+===============================
+
+The Ansible Network team develops and supports a set of `network-related roles <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network>`_ on Ansible Galaxy. You can use these roles to jump start your network automation efforts. These roles are updated approximately every two weeks to give you access to the latest Ansible networking content.
+
+These roles come in the following categories:
+
+* **User roles** - User roles focus on tasks, such as managing your configuration. Use these roles, such as `config_manager <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/config_manager>`_ and `cloud_vpn <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/cloud_vpn>`_, directly in your playbooks. These roles are platform/provider agnostic, allowing you to use the same roles and playbooks across different network platforms or cloud providers.
+* **Platform provider roles** - Provider roles translate between the user roles and the various network OSs, each of which has a different API. Each provider role accepts input from a supported user role and translates it for a specific network OS. Network user roles depend on these provider roles to implement their functions. For example, the `config_manager <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/config_manager>`_ user role  uses the  `cisco_ios <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/cisco_ios>`_ provider role to implement tasks on Cisco IOS network devices.
+* **Cloud provider and provisioner roles** - Similarly, cloud user roles depend on cloud provider and provisioner roles to implement cloud functions for specific cloud providers. For example, the `cloud_vpn <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/cloud_vpn>`_ role depends on the `aws <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/aws>`_ provider role to communicate with AWS.
+
+
+You need to install at least one platform provider role for your network user roles, and set ``ansible_network_provider`` to that provider (for example, ``ansible_network_provider: ansible-network.cisco_ios``). Ansible Galaxy automatically installs any other dependencies listed in the role details on Ansible Galaxy.
+
+For example, to use the ``config_manager`` role with Cisco IOS devices, you would use the following commands:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   [user@ansible]$ ansible-galaxy install ansible-network.cisco_nxos
+   [user@ansible]$ ansible-galaxy install ansible-network.config_manager
+
+Roles are fully documented with examples in Ansible Galaxy on the **Read Me** tab for each role.
+
+Network roles release cycle
+===========================
+
+The Ansible network team releases updates and new roles every two weeks. The role details on Ansible Galaxy lists the role versions available, and you can look in the GitHub repository to find the changelog file (for example,  the ``cisco_ios`` `CHANGELOG.rst <https://github.com/ansible-network/cisco_ios/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.rst>`_ ) that lists what has changed in each version of the role.
+
+The Ansible Galaxy role version has two components:
+
+* Major release number - (for example, 2.6) which shows the Ansible engine version this role supports.
+* Minor release number (for example .1) which denotes the role release cycle and does not reflect the Ansible engine minor release version.
+
+Update an installed role
+------------------------
+
+The Ansible Galaxy page for a role lists all available versions. To update a locally installed role to a new or different version, use the ``ansible-galaxy install`` command with the version and ``--force`` option. You may also need to manually update any dependent roles to support this version. See the role **Read Me** tab in Galaxy for dependent role minimum version requirements.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+  [user@ansible]$ ansible-galaxy install ansible-network.network_engine,v2.7.0 --force
+  [user@ansible]$ ansible-galaxy install ansible-network.cisco_nxos,v2.7.1 --force
