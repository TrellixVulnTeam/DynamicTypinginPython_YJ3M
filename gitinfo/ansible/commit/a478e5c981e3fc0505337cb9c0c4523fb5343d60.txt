+Coding Standards
+================
+
+We're not too strict on style considerations, but we require:

+   * python 2.6 compliant code, unless in ansible modules, then python *2.4* compliant code (no 'with', etc)
+   * 4-space indents, no tabs except in Makefiles
+   * under_scores for method names and variables, not camelCase
+   * GPLv3 license headers on all files, with copyright on new files with your name on it
+   * no single-line if statements, deeply nested list comprehensions, or clever use of metaclasses -- keep it simple
+   * comments where appropriate
