   This re-executes inventory scripts, but does not force them to ignore any cache they might use.
 * New delegate_facts directive, a boolean that allows you to apply facts to the delegated host (true/yes) instead of the inventory_hostname (no/false) which is the default and previous behaviour.
 * local connections now work with 'su' as a privilege escalation method
+* Ansible 2.0 has deprecated the “ssh” from ansible_ssh_user, ansible_ssh_host, and ansible_ssh_port to become ansible_user, ansible_host, and ansible_port.
 * New ssh configuration variables(`ansible_ssh_common_args`, `ansible_ssh_extra_args`) can be used to configure a
   per-group or per-host ssh ProxyCommand or set any other ssh options.
   `ansible_ssh_extra_args` is used to set options that are accepted only by ssh (not sftp or scp, which have their own analogous settings).
