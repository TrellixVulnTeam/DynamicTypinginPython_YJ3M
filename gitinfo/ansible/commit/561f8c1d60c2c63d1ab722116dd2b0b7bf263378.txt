    Update macOS installation instructions (#67058)
    
    On macOS Catalina ``pip install --user ansible`` results in warnings and errors. This updates the reference documents to reflect changes Catalina+ with a safe, easy install for Ansible, accessing pip as a module and installing ansible with --user.
