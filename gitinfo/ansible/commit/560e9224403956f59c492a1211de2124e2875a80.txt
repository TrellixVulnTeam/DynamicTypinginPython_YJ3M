+Setup

+Aliases can be used to execute setup targets before running tests:
+
+- ``setup/once/TARGET`` - Run the target ``TARGET`` before the first target that requires it.
+- ``setup/always/TARGET`` - Run the target ``TARGET`` before each target that requires it.

 - ``needs/ssh`` - Requires SSH connections to localhost (or the test container with ``--docker``) without a password.
+- ``needs/httptester`` - Requires use of the http-test-container to run tests.

+Dependencies
+------------

+Some test dependencies are automatically discovered:

+- Ansible role dependencies defined in ``meta/main.yml`` files.
+- Setup targets defined with ``setup/*`` aliases.
+- Symbolic links from one target to a file in another target.
