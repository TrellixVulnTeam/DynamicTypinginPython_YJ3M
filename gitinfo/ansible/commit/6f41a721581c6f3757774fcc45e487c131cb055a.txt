    Adds utf-8 encoding to f5 module_utils
    
    The contributor's name on line 10 (originally line 7) includes a character
    that the default Python encoding (ASCII) raises an error on when interpreting
    the file.
    
    Specifying the utf-8 encoding, as is done in other modules, resolves
    the error.
    
    The error being raised is
    
    SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc3' in file /.../lib/ansible/module_utils/f5.py
    on line 7, but no encoding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html
    for details
