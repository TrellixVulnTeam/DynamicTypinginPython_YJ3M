 to do quick things that you might not neccessarily want to write a full playbook 
 for.  
 
+Generally speaking, the true power of Ansible lies in playbooks.
 Why would you use ad-hoc tasks versus playbooks?
 
 For instance, if you wanted to power off all of your lab for Christmas vacation,
 you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook.
