+This issue may be related to locale or text encoding. To help troubleshoot and reproduce the issue, we need some additional information.
+
+If running ansible from the command line, try to gather this information from the same shell and terminal.
+
+To collect the locale, language and text encoding settings, use the ```locale``` command:
+``` shell
+    locale
+```
+
+That output should look something like:
+```
+LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
+LC_ALL=
+```
+
+If 'sudo' or similar tools are being used, we will need the locale info from a sudo shell as well.
+For example:
+``` shell
+sudo locale
+```
+
+Also include the value of the ```TERM``` environment variable. To get the info, paste the output of echoing the ```TERM``` variable from a shell like:
+``` shell
+echo $TERM
+```
+
+Cut & paste the output from those commands into a comment here. To preserve the original
+formatting, use \`\`\` around the text, for example:
+
+\`\`\`
+    LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
+    LC_ALL=
+\`\`\`
