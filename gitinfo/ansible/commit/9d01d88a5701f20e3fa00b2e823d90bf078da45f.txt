 Ansible manages machines in an agentless manner. There is never a question of how to
 upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled.  As OpenSSH is one of the most peer reviewed open source components, the security exposure of using the tool is greatly reduced.  Ansible is decentralized -- it relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines; if needed it can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized authentication management systems.
 
-This documentation covers the current released version of Ansible (1.4.5) and also some development version features (1.5).  For recent features, in each section, the version of Ansible where the feature is added is indicated.  Ansible, Inc releases a new major release of Ansible approximately every 2 months.  The core application evolves somewhat conservatively, valuing simplicity in language design and setup, while the community around new modules and plugins being developed and contributed moves very very quickly, typically adding 20 or so new modules in each release.
