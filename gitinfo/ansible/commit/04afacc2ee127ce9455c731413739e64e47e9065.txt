+- Some packages need an interactive user logon in order to install.  You can use (C(become)) to achieve this.
+- Even if you are connecting as local Administrator, using (C(become)) to become Administrator will give you an interactive user logon, see examples below.
+- Use (M(win_hotfix) to install hotfixes instead of (M(win_chocolatey)) as (M(win_hotfix)) avoids using wusa.exe which cannot be run remotely.
