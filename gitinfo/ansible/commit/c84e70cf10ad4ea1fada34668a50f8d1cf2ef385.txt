    Add note to `apt_key` doc about update requirement (#25111)
    
    * Add note about adding new key requiring update
    
    When a new repo and new key are added, attempts to install packages
    signed by that key fail until `apt-get update` is run.  This note
    is an attempt to help users avoid getting errors when they miss
    this step.
    
    * related to issue #25091
    
    * switch example to apt module

     - As a sanity check, downloaded key id must match the one specified.
