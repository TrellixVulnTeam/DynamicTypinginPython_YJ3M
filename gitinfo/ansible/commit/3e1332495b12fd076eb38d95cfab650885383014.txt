+# Docker_Image Module Proposal
+
+## Purpose and Scope
+
+The purpose is to update the existing docker_image module. The updates include expanding the module's capabilities to
+match the build, load, pull, push, rmi, and save docker commands and adding support for remote registries.
+
+Docker_image will manage images using docker-py to communicate with either a local or remote API. It will
+support API versions >= 1.14. API connection details will be handled externally in a shared utility module similar 
+to how other cloud modules operate.
+
+## Parameters
+
+Docker_image will support the parameters listed below. API connection parameters will be part of a shared utility 
+module as mentioned above.
+
+```
+archive_path:
+  description:
+    - Save image to the provided path. Use with state present to always save the image to a tar archive. If
+      intermediate directories in the path do not exist, they will be created. If a matching
+      archive already exists, it will be overwritten.
+  default: null
+
+config_path:
+  description:
+    - Path to a custom docker config file. Docker-py defaults to using ~/.docker/config.json.
+
+cgroup_parent:
+  description:
+    - Optional parent cgroup for build containers.
+  default: null
+
+cpu_shares:
+  description:
+    - CPU shares for build containers. Integer value.
+  default: 0
+
+cpuset_cpus:
+  description:
+    - CPUs in which to allow build container execution C(1,3) or C(1-3).
+  default: null
+
+dockerfile:
+  description:
+    - Name of dockerfile to use when building an image.
+  default: Dockerfile

+      in docker configuration file or when encoded credentials should be updated.
+  default: null
+  nolog: true
+
+force:
+  description:
+    - Use with absent state to un-tag and remove all images matching the specified name. Use with present state to
+      force a pull or rebuild of the image.
+  default: false
+
+load_path:
+  description:
+    - Use with state present to load a previously save image. Provide the full path to the image archive file.
+  default: null
+  
+memory:
+  description:
+    - Build container limit. Memory limit specified as a positive integer for number of bytes.
+
+memswap:
+  description:
+    - Build container limit. Total memory (memory + swap). Specify as a positive integer for number of bytes or
+      -1 to disable swap.
+  default: null
+
+name:
+  description:
+    - Image name or ID.
+  required: true

+nocache:
+  description:
+    - Do not use cache when building an image.

+  description:
+    - Path to Dockerfile and context from which to build an image.
+  default: null
+
+push:
+  description:
+    - Use with state present to always push an image to the registry.
+  default: false
+
+registry:
+  description:

+  default: null
+  
+rm:

+  default: latest
+
+url:
+  description:
+    - The location of a Git repository. The repository acts as the context when building an image.
+    - Mutually exclusive with path.

+      in docker configuration file or when encoded credentials should be updated.

+      matching the provided name.
+    - "present" - check if image is present with the provided tag. If the image is not present or the force option
+      is used, the image will either be pulled from the registry, built or loaded from an archive. To build the image,
+      provide a path or url to the context and Dockerfile. To load an image, use load_path to provide a path to
+      an archive file. If no path, url or load_path is provided, the image will be pulled. Use the registry
+      parameters to control the registry from which the image is pulled.
+    
+required: false
+default: present
+choices:
+  - absent
+  - present
+
