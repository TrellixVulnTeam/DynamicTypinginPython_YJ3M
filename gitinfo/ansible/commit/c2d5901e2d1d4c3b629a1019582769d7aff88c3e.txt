  * play output is now dynamically sized to terminal with a minimal of 80 coluumns (old default)
  * vars_prompt and pause are now skipped with a warning if the play is called non interactively (i.e. pull from cron)

-Vault changes:
  * most vault operations can now be done over multilple files
  * ansible-vault encrypt/decrypt read from stdin if no other input file is given,
    and can write to a given ``--output file``. This lets you avoid ever writing
    sensitive plaintext to disk.
  * ansible-vault rekey accepts the --new-vault-password-file option.
+ * many fixes and new options added to modules, too many to list here.
