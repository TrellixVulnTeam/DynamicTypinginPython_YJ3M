-You can also use other variables to specify your hosts (useful when using '-c ssh'). Suppose that you want to use in your inventory file the name four.example.com. That host has a sshd running on port 5309 (or have a firewall rule in front to redirect 5309->22) and is known in the DNS a four.example.org :
