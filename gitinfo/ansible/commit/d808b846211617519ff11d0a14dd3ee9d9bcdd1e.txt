+Before we get started, it is important to understand how Ansible communicates with remote
 machines over the `SSH protocol <https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/>`_.
 
 By default, Ansible will try to use native
 OpenSSH for remote communication when possible.  This enables ControlPersist (a performance feature), Kerberos, and options in ``~/.ssh/config`` such as Jump Host setup.  However, when using Enterprise Linux 6 operating systems as the control machine (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS), the version of OpenSSH may be too old to support ControlPersist. On these operating systems, Ansible will fallback into using a high-quality Python implementation of
 OpenSSH called 'paramiko'.  If you wish to use features like Kerberized SSH and more, consider using Fedora, macOS, or Ubuntu as your control machine until a newer version of OpenSSH is available for your platform.

 When speaking with remote machines, Ansible by default assumes you are using SSH keys.  SSH keys are encouraged but password authentication can also be used where needed by supplying the option ``--ask-pass``.  If using sudo features and when sudo requires a password, also supply ``--ask-become-pass`` (previously ``--ask-sudo-pass`` which has been deprecated).

 While it may be common sense, it is worth sharing: Any management system benefits from being run near the machines being managed. If you are running Ansible in a cloud, consider running it from a machine inside that cloud.  In most cases this will work better than on the open Internet.
 
-As an advanced topic, Ansible doesn't just have to connect remotely over SSH.  The transports are pluggable, and there are options for managing things locally, as well as managing chroot, lxc, and jail containers.  A mode called 'ansible-pull' can also invert the system and have systems 'phone home' via scheduled git checkouts to pull configuration directives from a central repository.
