 Python API
 ==========
 
+.. contents:: Topics
+
 There are several interesting ways to use Ansible from an API perspective.   You can use
 the Ansible python API to control nodes, you can extend Ansible to respond to various python events, you can
 write various plugins, and you can plug in inventory data from external data sources.  This document

 Developing Plugins
 ==================
 
+.. contents:: Topics

 Ansible is pluggable in a lot of other ways separate from inventory scripts and callbacks.  Many of these features are there to cover fringe use cases and are infrequently needed, and others are pluggable simply because they are there to implement core features
 in ansible and were most convenient to be made pluggable.

 Patterns in Ansible are how we decide which hosts to manage.  This can mean what hosts to communicate with, but in terms
 of :doc:`playbooks` it actually means what hosts to apply a particular configuration or IT process to.

 When ansible-playbook is executed with --check it will not make any changes on remote systems.  Instead, any module
 instrumented to support 'check mode' (which contains most of the primary core modules, but it is not required that all modules do
 this) will report what changes they would have made rather than making them.  Other modules that do not support check mode will also take no action, but just will not report what changes they might have made.

 Being designed for multi-tier deployments since the beginning, Ansible is great at doing things on one host on behalf of another, or doing local steps with reference to some remote hosts.
 
 This in particular this is very applicable when setting up continuous deployment infrastructure or zero downtime rolling updates, where you might be talking with load balancers or monitoring systems.
