 Note that the types of items you iterate over with 'with_items' do not have to be simple lists of strings.
 If you have a list of hashes, you can reference subkeys using things like::
 
-    {{ item.subKeyName }}
+    - name: add several users
+      action: user name={{ item.name }} state=present groups={{ item.groups }}
