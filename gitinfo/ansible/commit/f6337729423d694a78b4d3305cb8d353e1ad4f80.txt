 Ansible has a lot of documentation and a small team of writers. Community support helps us keep up with new features, fixes, and changes.
 
-Improving the documentation is an easy way to make your first contribution to the Ansible project. You don't have to be a programmer, since our documentation is written in YAML (module documentation) or `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (rST). If you're using Ansible, you already use YAML in your playbooks. And rST is mostly just text. You don't even need git experience, if you use the ``Edit on GitHub`` option.
