+Ansible supports the two most recent major, stable releases. Security- and bug-related fixes may be implemented in older versions, but this
+support is not guaranteed.
+
+If you are on a release older than the last two major, stable releases, please see our `Porting Guide <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/porting_guide_2.0.html>`_.

 Ansible is on a 'flexible' 4 month release schedule, sometimes this can be extended if there is a major change that requires a longer cycle (i.e. 2.0 core rewrite).
 Currently modules get released at the same time as the main Ansible repo, even though they are separated into ansible-modules-core and ansible-modules-extras.
