 notes:
    - rsync must be installed on both the local and remote host.
    - For the C(synchronize) module, the "local host" is the host `the synchronize task originates on`, and the "destination host" is the host `synchronize is connecting to`.
-   - The "local host" can be changed to a different host by using `delegate_to:`.  This enables copying between two remote hosts or entirely on one remote machine.
-   - "The user and permissions for the synchronize `src` are those of the user running the Ansible task on the local host (or the remote_user for a delegate_to host when delegate_to is used).
-   - The user and permissions for the synchronize `dest` are those of the `remote_user` on the destination host or the `become_user` if `become: yes` is active.

    - In 2.0.0.0 a bug in the synchronize module made become occur on the "local host".  This was fixed in 2.0.1.
    - Expect that dest=~/x will be ~<remote_user>/x even if using sudo.
    - Inspect the verbose output to validate the destination user/host/path
