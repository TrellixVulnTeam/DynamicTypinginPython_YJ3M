    Enable unit tests on Python 3.5
    
    This enables the tests in tox and in Travis.  This ought to prevent
    regressions in Python 3 support.
    
    Note that Python 3.4 isn't supported (yet) because the vault code relies on
    %-formatting of byte strings, a feature that was ripped out of Python 3.0
    and restored in 3.5.
    
    Also note that passing tests don't mean that Ansible itself can already
    be used with Python 3.5: test coverage is only 53%.
