 The vault feature can encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible.  This can include "group_vars/" or "host_vars/" inventory variables, variables loaded by "include_vars" or "vars_files", or variable files passed on the ansible-playbook command line with "-e @file.yml" or "-e @file.json".  Role variables and defaults are also included!
 
-Because Ansible tasks, handlers, and so on are also data, these two can also be encrypted with vault.  If you'd like to not betray what variables you are even using, you can go as far to keep an individual task file entirely encrypted.  However, that might be a little much and could annoy your coworkers :)
