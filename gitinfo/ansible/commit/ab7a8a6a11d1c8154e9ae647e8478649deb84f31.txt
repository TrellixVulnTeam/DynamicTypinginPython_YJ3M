    Work around a software bug in vSphere
    
    Due to a software bug in vSphere, it fails to handle ampersand in datacenter names.
    The solution is to do what vSphere does (when browsing) and double-encode ampersands.
    
    It is likely other characters need special treatment like this as well, haven't found any.
