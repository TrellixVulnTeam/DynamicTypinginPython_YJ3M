+Roles can also be dependent on other roles, and when you install a role that has dependencies, those dependencies will automatically be installed.
 
 You specify role dependencies in the ``meta/main.yml`` file by providing a list of roles. If the source of a role is Galaxy, you can simply specify the role in
 the format ``username.role_name``. The more complex format used in ``requirements.yml`` is also supported, allowing you to provide ``src``, ``scm``, ``version``, and ``name``.
