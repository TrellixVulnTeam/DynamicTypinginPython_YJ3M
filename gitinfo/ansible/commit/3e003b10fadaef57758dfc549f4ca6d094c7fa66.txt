    Reminder that lookup(‘file’) can be used (#20649)
    
    * Reminder that lookup(‘file’) can be used
    
    Sometimes the block of text does not easily fit into a playbook, so this acts as a reminder (or a prompt for anyone who hasn't used this before) that the content could be stored in an separate file.
    
    I've also included `backup: yes` as I think this is a good example of where a backup might be needed.
    
    * Correct the not so "smart quotes"
    
    * Update blockinfile.py
    
    Replace – with an an ASCII -
