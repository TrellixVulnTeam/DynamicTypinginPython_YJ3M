 accelerate_ipv6: DEPRECATED, set to True to force accelerate plugin to use ipv6 for it's connection.
 accelerate_port: DEPRECATED, set to override default port use for accelerate connection.
 action: The 'action' to execute for a task, it normally translates into a C(module) or action plugin.
+args: DEPRECATED, A secondary way to add arguments into a task, it takes a dictionary in which keys map to options and values .. well you get it.
 always: List of tasks, in a block, that execute no matter if there is an error in the block or not.
 always_run: DEPRECATED, forces a task to run even in check mode, use check_mode directive instead.
 any_errors_fatal: Force any un-handled task errors on any host to propagate to all hosts and end the play.

 changed_when: Conditional expression that overrides the task's normal 'changed' status.
 check_mode: A boolean that controls if a task is executed in 'check' mode
 connection: Allows you to change the connection plugin used for tasks to execute on the target.
+delay: Number of seconds to delay between retries, this setting only makes sense when used with 'until'.
 delegate_facts: Boolean that allows you to apply facts to delegated host instead of inventory_hostname.
 delegate_to: Host to execute task instead of the target (inventory_hostname), connection vars from the delegated host will also be used for the task.
 environment: A dictionary that gets converted into environment vars to be provided for the task upon execution.

 handlers: A section with tasks that are treated as handlers, these won't get executed normally, only when notified. After each section of tasks is complete.
 hosts: A list of groups, hosts or host pattern that translates into a list of hosts that are the play's target.
 ignore_errors: Boolean that allows you to ignore task failures and continue with play. It does not affect connection errors.
+loop_control: Several keys here allow you to modify/set loop behaviour in a task see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_loops.html#loop-control for details.
 max_fail_percentage: can be used to abort the run after a given percentage of hosts in the current batch has failed.
 name: It's a name, works mostly for documentation, in the case of tasks/handlers it can be an identifier.
 no_log: Boolean that controls information disclosure.
+notify: list of handlers to notify when the task returns a 'changed=True' status.
 order: Controls the sorting of hosts as they are used for executing the play. Possible values are inventory (default), sorted, reverse_sorted, reverse_inventory and shuffle.
+poll: Sets the polling interval in seconds for async tasks (default 10s).
 port: Used to override the default port used in a connection.
 post_tasks: A list of tasks to execute after the ``tasks`` section.
 pre_tasks: A list of tasks to execute before ``roles``.
 remote_user: User used to log into the target via the connection plugin. AKA login user.
+register: Name of variable that will contain task status and module return data.
 rescue: List of tasks in a block that run if there is a task error in the main ``block`` list.
+retries: Number of retries before giving up in a 'until' loop, this setting is ignored on it's own.
+roles: List of roles to be imported into the play
 run_once: Boolean that will bypass the host loop, forcing the task to execute on the first host available and will also apply any facts to all active hosts.
 serial: Defines the 'batch' of hosts to execute the current play until the end.
 strategy: Allows you to choose the connection plugin to use for the play.
 tags: Tags applied to the task or included tasks, this allows selecting subsets of tasks from the command line.
 tasks: Main list of tasks to execute in the play, they run after ``roles`` and before ``post_tasks``.
+until: This keyword implies a 'retry loop' that will go on until the condition supplied here is met or we hit the retry limit.
 vars: Dictionary/map of variables
 vars_files: List of files that contain vars to include in the play.
 vars_prompt: list of variables to prompt for.
