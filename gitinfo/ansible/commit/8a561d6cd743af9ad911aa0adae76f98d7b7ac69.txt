    Adopt best practices with distributing portfiles

    on how to get the development version of ansible installed using macports.

+## Installing the devel version of ansible via macports
+
+To use this Portfile to install the development version of ansible one should
+follow the instructions at
+<http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories>
+
+The basic idea is to add the _ansible/packaging/macports_ directory to your
+_/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf_ file. You should have something similar
+to this at the end of the file
+
+  file:///Users/jtang/develop/ansible/packaging/macports
+  rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/ports.tar [default]
+
+In the _ansible/packaging/macports_ directory, do this
+
+  $ portindex
+
+Once the index is created the _Portfile_ will override the one in the upstream
+macports repository.
+
+Installing newer development versions should involve an uninstall, clean,
+install process or else the Portfile will need its version number/epoch
+bumped.
