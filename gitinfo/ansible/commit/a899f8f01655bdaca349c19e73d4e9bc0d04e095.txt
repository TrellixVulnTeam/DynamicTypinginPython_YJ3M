    Fix for task_executor on OS X
    
    I get this exception during the setup task:
    
    AttributeError: 'ConnectionInformation' object has no attribute 'remote_pass'
    
    I believe it is supposed to be looking at the password attribute. Either that
    or we should create a remote_pass attribute in ConnectionInformation.
