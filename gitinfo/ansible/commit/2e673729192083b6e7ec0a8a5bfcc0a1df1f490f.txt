    Make the example somewhat more feature complete
    
    New users might think that "state=started" implies that the service is also started at boot-time, which isn't.
    By adding it, this change makes a clear distinction between the service state, and whether it is enabled (at boot).
    And makes the example more feature-complete as this is what most people would be doing anyway.
