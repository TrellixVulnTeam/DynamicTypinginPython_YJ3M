    This conditional example is no longer needed.

-# this is a demo of conditional executions using 'only_if', which can skip
-# certain tasks on machines/platforms/etc where they do not apply.  This is
-# the more 'raw' version of the 'when' statement, most users will be able to
-# use 'when' directly.  'only_if' is an older feature, and useful for when
-# you need more advanced expression control.

-  user: root

-     favcolor: "red"

-# Below we're going to define some expressions.
-#
-# Not only can we assign variables for reuse, but we can also assign conditional
-# expressions.  By keeping these in 'vars', the task section remains
-# extraordinarily clean, and not littered with programming language
-# constructs -- so it's easily skimmed by humans.
-#
-# Remember to quote any variables if they are not numbers!
-#
-# Interesting fact: aside from the $variables, these expressions are actually
-# tiny bits of Python.  They are evaluated in the context of each host, so different
-# steps can be skipped on different hosts!  They should evaluate to either True
-# or False

-     is_favcolor_blue: "'$favcolor' == 'blue'"
-     is_centos: "'$facter_operatingsystem' == 'CentOS'"
-
-# NOTE:
-#
-# setup module values, facter and ohai variables can be used in only_if statements too
-# ex:  "'$facter_operatingsystem' == 'CentOS'", which bubble up automatically
-# from the managed machines.  This example doesn't do that though.
