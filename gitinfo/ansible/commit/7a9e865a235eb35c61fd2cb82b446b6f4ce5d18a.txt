 description:
      - Provide one or more image names, and the module will inspect each, returning an array of inspection results.
+     - If an image does not exist locally, it will not appear in the results. If you want to check whether an image exists
+       locally, you can call the module with the image name, then check whether the result list is empty (image does not
+       exist) or has one element (the image exists locally).
+     - The module will not attempt to pull images from registries. Use M(docker_image) with I(source) set to C(pull)
+       to ensure an image is pulled.
 
 notes:
      - This module was called C(docker_image_facts) before Ansible 2.8. The usage did not change.
