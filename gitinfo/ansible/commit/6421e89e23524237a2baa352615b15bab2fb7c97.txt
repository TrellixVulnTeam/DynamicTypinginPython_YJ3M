    docs: refresh testing_integration.rst (#53338)
    
    * docs: refresh testing_integration.rst
    
    Ensures the examples can be run:
    - fedora25 is not available anymore, use fedora29 instead
    - the posix/ci alias does not exist anymore, use shippable/posix/ instead
    - explain how to list the target without argcomplete
    
    * ansible-test should be in $PATH
    * call ansible-runner from bin/, not test/runner
    * we don't use credentials.template anymore, we use a collection of .template files.
    * low-case bash bc we refresh to name of the binary
    * refresh the command of Windows-CI example
    * Update docs/docsite/rst/dev_guide/testing_integration.rst

 Making your own version of ``integration_config.yml`` can allow for setting some
