commit 78b5cd64d0a5d396063212e905cbd135b6a329ad
Author: Michael DeHaan <michael.dehaan@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 16 23:45:15 2012 -0400

    Add pydoc for constructors.  Some arguments can be trimmed as we plan to remove the need for them (like setup_cache and
    maybe module_vars) with various pending refactoring.
