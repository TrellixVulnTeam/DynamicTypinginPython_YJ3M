    Remove call to undefined debug() in module 'user'.
    
    I think when we stopped using stderr for debugging modules because
    paramiko didn't like it, many modules used the idiom of defining
    a debug function that used standard error. The def's and calls were
    removed.
    
    This looks like a stray debug() that didn't get removed and didn't
    show up unless you alter a user's groups. If it's hit, 'user' fails
    with a global undefined function error.
