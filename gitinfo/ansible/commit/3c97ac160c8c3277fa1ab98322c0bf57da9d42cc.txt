+While you can file a feature request on GitHub, pull requests are a much better way to get your feature added than submitting a feature request.  Open source is all about itch scratching, and it's less likely that someone else will have the same itches as yourself.  We keep code reasonably simple on purpose so it's easy to dive in and make additions, but be sure to read the "Contributing Code" section below too -- as it doesn't hurt to have a discussion about a feature first -- we're inclined to have preferences about how incoming features might be implemented, and that can save confusion later.

+
+A Note About Priorities
+=======================
+
+Ansible was one of the top 5 projects with the most OSS contributors on GitHub in 2013, and well over
+600 people have added code to the project.  As a result, we have a LOT of incoming activity to process.
+
+In the interest of transparency, we're telling you how we do this.
+
+In our bug tracker you'll notice some labels - P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5.  These are our internal
+priority orders that we use to sort tickets.  
+
+With some exceptions for easy merges (like documentation typos for instance), 
+we're going to spend most of our time working on P1 and P2 items first, including pull requests.  
+These usually relate to important
+bugs or features affecting large segments of the userbase.  So if you see something categorized
+"P3 or P4", and it's not appearing to get a lot of immediate attention, this is why.
+
+These labels don't really have definition - they are a simple ordering.  However something
+affecting a major module (yum, apt, etc) is likely to be prioritized higher than a module
+affecting a smaller number of users.
+
+Since we place a strong emphasis on testing and code review, it may take a few months for a minor feature to get merged.
+
+Don't worry though -- we'll also take periodic sweeps through the lower priority queues and give
+them some attention as well, particularly in the area of new module changes.  So it doesn't neccessarily
+mean that we'll be exhausting all of the higher-priority queues before getting to your ticket.
+
+Release Numbering
+=================
+
+Releases ending in ".0" are major releases and this is where all new features land.  Releases ending
+in another integer, like "0.X.1" and "0.X.2" are dot releases, and these are only going to contain
+bugfixes.  Typically we don't do dot releases for minor releases, but may occasionally decide to cut
+dot releases containing a large number of smaller fixes if it's still a fairly long time before
+the next release comes out.
