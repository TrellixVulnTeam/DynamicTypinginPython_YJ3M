+
+Installing roles from Galaxy
+============================
+
+The ``ansible-galaxy`` command comes bundled with Ansible, and you can use it to install roles from Galaxy or directly from a git based SCM. You can
+also use it to create a new role, remove roles, or perform tasks on the Galaxy website.
+
+The command line tool by default communicates with the Galaxy website API using the server address *https://galaxy.ansible.com*. Since the `Galaxy project <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy>`_
+is an open source project, you may be running your own internal Galaxy server and wish to override the default server address. You can do this using the *--server* option
+or by setting the Galaxy server value in your *ansible.cfg* file. For information on setting the value in *ansible.cfg* see :ref:`galaxy_server`.
+
+
+Installing roles
+----------------
+
+Use the ``ansible-galaxy`` command to download roles from the `Galaxy website <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+  $ ansible-galaxy install namespace.role_name
+
+Setting where to install roles
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+By default, Ansible downloads roles to the first writable directory in the default list of paths ``~/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles``. This installs roles in the home directory of the user running ``ansible-galaxy``.
+
+You can override this with one of the following options:
+
+* Set the environment variable :envvar:`ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` in your session.
+* Define ``roles_path`` in an ``ansible.cfg`` file.
+* Use the ``--roles-path`` option for the ``ansible-galaxy`` command.
+
+The following provides an example of using ``--roles-path`` to install the role into the current working directory:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ ansible-galaxy install --roles-path . geerlingguy.apache
+
+.. seealso::
+
+   :ref:`intro_configuration`
+      All about configuration files
+
+Installing a specific version of a role
+---------------------------------------
+
+When the Galaxy server imports a role, it imports any git tags matching the Semantic Version format as versions. In turn, you can download a specific version of a role by specifying one of the imported tags.
+
+To see the available versions for a role:
+
+#. Locate the role on the Galaxy search page.
+#. Click on the name to view more details, including the available versions.
+
+You can also navigate directly to the role using the /<namespace>/<role name>. For example, to view the role geerlingguy.apache, go to `<https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/apache>`_.
+
+To install a specific version of a role from Galaxy, append a comma and the value of a GitHub release tag. For example:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   $ ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache,v1.0.0
+
+It is also possible to point directly to the git repository and specify a branch name or commit hash as the version. For example, the following will
+install a specific commit:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+   $ ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-apache.git,0b7cd353c0250e87a26e0499e59e7fd265cc2f25
+
+Installing multiple roles from a file
+-------------------------------------
+
+You can install multiple roles by including the roles in a :file:`requirements.yml` file. The format of the file is YAML, and the
+file extension must be either *.yml* or *.yaml*.
+
+Use the following command to install roles included in :file:`requirements.yml:`
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
+
+Again, the extension is important. If the *.yml* extension is left off, the ``ansible-galaxy`` CLI assumes the file is in an older, now deprecated,
+"basic" format.
+
+Each role in the file will have one or more of the following attributes:
+
+   src
+     The source of the role. Use the format *namespace.role_name*, if downloading from Galaxy; otherwise, provide a URL pointing
+     to a repository within a git based SCM. See the examples below. This is a required attribute.
+   scm
+     Specify the SCM. As of this writing only *git* or *hg* are allowed. See the examples below. Defaults to *git*.
+   version:
+     The version of the role to download. Provide a release tag value, commit hash, or branch name. Defaults to the branch set as a default in the repository, otherwise defaults to the *master*.
+   name:
+     Download the role to a specific name. Defaults to the Galaxy name when downloading from Galaxy, otherwise it defaults
+     to the name of the repository.
+
+Use the following example as a guide for specifying roles in *requirements.yml*:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    # from galaxy
+    - src: yatesr.timezone
+
+    # from GitHub
+    - src: https://github.com/bennojoy/nginx
+
+    # from GitHub, overriding the name and specifying a specific tag
+    - src: https://github.com/bennojoy/nginx
+      version: master
+      name: nginx_role
+
+    # from a webserver, where the role is packaged in a tar.gz
+    - src: https://some.webserver.example.com/files/master.tar.gz
+      name: http-role-gz
+
+    # from a webserver, where the role is packaged in a tar.bz2
+    - src: https://some.webserver.example.com/files/master.tar.bz2
+      name: http-role-bz2
+
+    # from a webserver, where the role is packaged in a tar.xz (Python 3.x only)
+    - src: https://some.webserver.example.com/files/master.tar.xz
+      name: http-role-xz
+
+    # from Bitbucket
+    - src: git+https://bitbucket.org/willthames/git-ansible-galaxy
+      version: v1.4
+
+    # from Bitbucket, alternative syntax and caveats
+    - src: https://bitbucket.org/willthames/hg-ansible-galaxy
+      scm: hg
+
+    # from GitLab or other git-based scm, using git+ssh
+    - src: git@gitlab.company.com:mygroup/ansible-base.git
+      scm: git
+      version: "0.1"  # quoted, so YAML doesn't parse this as a floating-point value
+
+Installing multiple roles from multiple files
+---------------------------------------------
+
+For large projects, the ``include`` directive in a :file:`requirements.yml` file provides the ability to split a large file into multiple smaller files.
+
+For example, a project may have a :file:`requirements.yml` file, and a :file:`webserver.yml` file.
+
+Below are the contents of the :file:`webserver.yml` file:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    # from github
+    - src: https://github.com/bennojoy/nginx
+
+    # from Bitbucket
+    - src: git+http://bitbucket.org/willthames/git-ansible-galaxy
+      version: v1.4
+
+The following shows the contents of the :file:`requirements.yml` file that now includes the :file:`webserver.yml` file:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+  # from galaxy
+  - src: yatesr.timezone
+  - include: <path_to_requirements>/webserver.yml
+
+To install all the roles from both files, pass the root file, in this case :file:`requirements.yml` on the
+command line, as follows:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
+
+.. _galaxy_dependencies:
+
+Dependencies
+------------
+
+Roles can also be dependent on other roles, and when you install a role that has dependencies, those dependencies will automatically be installed.
+
+You specify role dependencies in the ``meta/main.yml`` file by providing a list of roles. If the source of a role is Galaxy, you can simply specify the role in
+the format ``namespace.role_name``. You can also use the more complex format in ``requirements.yml``, allowing you to provide ``src``, ``scm``, ``version``, and ``name``.
+
+The following shows an example ``meta/main.yml`` file with dependent roles:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    ---
+    dependencies:
+      - geerlingguy.java
+
+    galaxy_info:
+      author: geerlingguy
+      description: Elasticsearch for Linux.
+      company: "Midwestern Mac, LLC"
+      license: "license (BSD, MIT)"
+      min_ansible_version: 2.4
+      platforms:
+      - name: EL
+        versions:
+        - all
+      - name: Debian
+        versions:
+        - all
+      - name: Ubuntu
+        versions:
+        - all
+      galaxy_tags:
+        - web
+        - system
+        - monitoring
+        - logging
+        - lucene
+        - elk
+        - elasticsearch
+
+Tags are inherited *down* the dependency chain. In order for tags to be applied to a role and all its dependencies, the tag should be applied to the role, not to all the tasks within a role.
+
+Roles listed as dependencies are subject to conditionals and tag filtering, and may not execute fully depending on
+what tags and conditionals are applied.
+
+If the source of a role is Galaxy, specify the role in the format *namespace.role_name*:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    dependencies:
+      - geerlingguy.apache
+      - geerlingguy.ansible
+
+
+Alternately, you can specify the role dependencies in the complex form used in  :file:`requirements.yml` as follows:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    dependencies:
+      - src: geerlingguy.ansible
+      - src: git+https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-composer.git
+        version: 775396299f2da1f519f0d8885022ca2d6ee80ee8
+        name: composer
+
+When dependencies are encountered by ``ansible-galaxy``, it will automatically install each dependency to the ``roles_path``. To understand how dependencies are handled during play execution, see :ref:`playbooks_reuse_roles`.
+
+.. note::
+
+    Galaxy expects all role dependencies to exist in Galaxy, and therefore dependencies to be specified in the
+    ``namespace.role_name`` format. If you import a role with a dependency where the ``src`` value is a URL, the import process will fail.
+
+List installed roles
+--------------------
+
+Use ``list`` to show the name and version of each role installed in the *roles_path*.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ ansible-galaxy list
+      - ansible-network.network-engine, v2.7.2
+      - ansible-network.config_manager, v2.6.2
+      - ansible-network.cisco_nxos, v2.7.1
+      - ansible-network.vyos, v2.7.3
+    - ansible-network.cisco_ios, v2.7.0
+
+Remove an installed role
+------------------------
+
+Use ``remove`` to delete a role from *roles_path*:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ ansible-galaxy remove namespace.role_name
+
+
+.. seealso::
+  `collections <collections>`_

-Installing roles from Galaxy
-============================
-
-The ``ansible-galaxy`` command comes bundled with Ansible, and you can use it to install roles from Galaxy or directly from a git based SCM. You can
-also use it to create a new role, remove roles, or perform tasks on the Galaxy website.
-
-The command line tool by default communicates with the Galaxy website API using the server address *https://galaxy.ansible.com*. Since the `Galaxy project <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy>`_
-is an open source project, you may be running your own internal Galaxy server and wish to override the default server address. You can do this using the *--server* option
-or by setting the Galaxy server value in your *ansible.cfg* file. For information on setting the value in *ansible.cfg* see :ref:`galaxy_server`.
-
-
-Installing Roles
-----------------
-
-Use the ``ansible-galaxy`` command to download roles from the `Galaxy website <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-  $ ansible-galaxy install username.role_name
-
-roles_path
-^^^^^^^^^^
-
-By default Ansible downloads roles to the first writable directory in the default list of paths ``~/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles``. This will install roles in the home directory of the user running ``ansible-galaxy``.
-
-You can override this by setting the environment variable :envvar:`ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` in your session, defining ``roles_path`` in an ``ansible.cfg`` file, or by using the ``--roles-path`` option.
-
-The following provides an example of using ``--roles-path`` to install the role into the current working directory:
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    $ ansible-galaxy install --roles-path . geerlingguy.apache
-
-.. seealso::
-
-   :ref:`intro_configuration`
-      All about configuration files
-
-Installing a specific version of a role
----------------------------------------
-
-You can install a specific version of a role from Galaxy by appending a comma and the value of a GitHub release tag. For example:
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-   $ ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache,v1.0.0
-
-It's also possible to point directly to the git repository and specify a branch name or commit hash as the version. For example, the following will
-install a specific commit:
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-   $ ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-apache.git,0b7cd353c0250e87a26e0499e59e7fd265cc2f25
-
-
-Installing multiple roles from a file
--------------------------------------
-
-Beginning with Ansible 1.8 it is possible to install multiple roles by including the roles in a *requirements.yml* file. The format of the file is YAML, and the
-file extension must be either *.yml* or *.yaml*.
-
-Use the following command to install roles included in *requirements.yml*:
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
-
-Again, the extension is important. If the *.yml* extension is left off, the ``ansible-galaxy`` CLI assumes the file is in an older, now deprecated,
-"basic" format.
-
-Each role in the file will have one or more of the following attributes:
-
-   src
-     The source of the role. Use the format *username.role_name*, if downloading from Galaxy; otherwise, provide a URL pointing
-     to a repository within a git based SCM. See the examples below. This is a required attribute.
-   scm
-     Specify the SCM. As of this writing only *git* or *hg* are allowed. See the examples below. Defaults to *git*.
-   version:
-     The version of the role to download. Provide a release tag value, commit hash, or branch name. Defaults to the branch set as a default in the repository, otherwise defaults to the *master*.
-   name:
-     Download the role to a specific name. Defaults to the Galaxy name when downloading from Galaxy, otherwise it defaults
-     to the name of the repository.
-
-Use the following example as a guide for specifying roles in *requirements.yml*:
-
-.. code-block:: text
-
-    # from galaxy
-    - src: yatesr.timezone
-
-    # from GitHub
-    - src: https://github.com/bennojoy/nginx
-
-    # from GitHub, overriding the name and specifying a specific tag
-    - src: https://github.com/bennojoy/nginx
-      version: master
-      name: nginx_role
-
-    # from a webserver, where the role is packaged in a tar.gz
-    - src: https://some.webserver.example.com/files/master.tar.gz
-      name: http-role-gz
-
-    # from a webserver, where the role is packaged in a tar.bz2
-    - src: https://some.webserver.example.com/files/master.tar.bz2
-      name: http-role-bz2
-
-    # from a webserver, where the role is packaged in a tar.xz (Python 3.x only)
-    - src: https://some.webserver.example.com/files/master.tar.xz
-      name: http-role-xz
-
-    # from Bitbucket
-    - src: git+https://bitbucket.org/willthames/git-ansible-galaxy
-      version: v1.4
-
-    # from Bitbucket, alternative syntax and caveats
-    - src: https://bitbucket.org/willthames/hg-ansible-galaxy
-      scm: hg
-
-    # from GitLab or other git-based scm, using git+ssh
-    - src: git@gitlab.company.com:mygroup/ansible-base.git
-      scm: git
-      version: "0.1"  # quoted, so YAML doesn't parse this as a floating-point value
-
-Installing multiple roles from multiple files
----------------------------------------------
-
-At a basic level, including requirements files allows you to break up bits of roles into smaller files. Role includes pull in roles from other files.
-
-Use the following command to install roles includes in *requirements.yml*  + *webserver.yml*
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
-
-Content of the *requirements.yml* file:
-
-.. code-block:: text
-
-    # from galaxy
-    - src: yatesr.timezone
-
-    - include: <path_to_requirements>/webserver.yml
-
-
-Content of the *webserver.yml* file:
-
-.. code-block:: text
-
-    # from github
-    - src: https://github.com/bennojoy/nginx
-
-    # from Bitbucket
-    - src: git+https://bitbucket.org/willthames/git-ansible-galaxy
-      version: v1.4
-
-.. _galaxy_dependencies:
-
-Dependencies
-------------
-
-Roles can also be dependent on other roles, and when you install a role that has dependencies, those dependencies will automatically be installed.
-
-You specify role dependencies in the ``meta/main.yml`` file by providing a list of roles. If the source of a role is Galaxy, you can simply specify the role in
-the format ``username.role_name``. You can also use the more complex format in ``requirements.yml``, allowing you to provide ``src``, ``scm``, ``version``, and ``name``.
-
-Tags are inherited *down* the dependency chain. In order for tags to be applied to a role and all its dependencies, the tag should be applied to the role, not to all the tasks within a role.
-
-Roles listed as dependencies are subject to conditionals and tag filtering, and may not execute fully depending on
-what tags and conditionals are applied.
-
-Dependencies found in Galaxy can be specified as follows:
-
-.. code-block:: text
-
-    dependencies:
-      - geerlingguy.apache
-      - geerlingguy.ansible
-
-
-The complex form can also be used as follows:
-
-.. code-block:: text
-
-    dependencies:
-      - src: geerlingguy.ansible
-      - src: git+https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-composer.git
-        version: 775396299f2da1f519f0d8885022ca2d6ee80ee8
-        name: composer
-
-When dependencies are encountered by ``ansible-galaxy``, it will automatically install each dependency to the ``roles_path``. To understand how dependencies are handled during play execution, see :ref:`playbooks_reuse_roles`.
-
-.. note::
-
-    At the time of this writing, the Galaxy website expects all role dependencies to exist in Galaxy, and therefore dependencies to be specified in the
-    ``username.role_name`` format. If you import a role with a dependency where the ``src`` value is a URL, the import process will fail.
-
-List installed roles
---------------------
-
-Use ``list`` to show the name and version of each role installed in the *roles_path*.
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    $ ansible-galaxy list
-
-    - chouseknecht.role-install_mongod, master
-    - chouseknecht.test-role-1, v1.0.2
-    - chrismeyersfsu.role-iptables, master
-    - chrismeyersfsu.role-required_vars, master
-
-Remove an installed role
-------------------------
-
-Use ``remove`` to delete a role from *roles_path*:
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    $ ansible-galaxy remove username.role_name
