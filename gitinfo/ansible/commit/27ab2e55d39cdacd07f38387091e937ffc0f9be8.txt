    Service mod.: Proper(?) handling of return code 69
    
    This adds "69" to the return codes from the status command that should be
    considered as not running. At least "django-celery" uses this return code,
    maybe others::
    
        /venv/bin/python /code/project/manage.py celeryctl status
        echo $? # 69 when not running.
    
    A bit of googling let me to http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html and
    on a Ubuntu Server 12.10 I get::
    
        ~# cat /usr/include/sysexits.h | grep 69
        #define EX_UNAVAILABLE      69      /* service unavailable */
    
    I'm not sure if the content of sysexits.h is the same on other OS'es.
