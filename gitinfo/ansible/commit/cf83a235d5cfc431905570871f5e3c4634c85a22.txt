+This document is now the location for published Ansible Core roadmaps.
 
 The roadmap will be updated by version. Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (2.0, 2.1).  Subminor versions will generally not have roadmaps published.
 
-2.1 was the first time Ansible has published this and asked for feedback in this manner.  So feedback on the roadmap and the new process is quite welcome.  The team is aiming for further transparency and better inclusion of both community desires and submissions.  
+2.1 was the first time Ansible has published this and asked for feedback in this manner.  So feedback on the roadmap and the new process is quite welcome.  The team is aiming for further transparency and better inclusion of both community desires and submissions.
 
 These roadmaps are the team's *best guess* roadmaps based on the Ansible team's experience and are also based on requests and feedback from the community.  There are things that may not make it on due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc.  And there may be things that got missed, so each roadmap is published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible, and as a medium for seeking further feedback from the community. Here are the good places for you to submit feedback:
 
   - Ansible's google-group: ansible-devel
-  -  Ansible Fest conferences.

   - IRC freenode channel: #ansible-devel (this one may have things lost in lots of conversation, so a caution).

+Ansible by Red Hat, Core 2.4
+============================
+
+**Target Delivery: June/July 2017**
+
+This is meant to be a living document, and is by no means **FINAL** until
+stated otherwise in the document.
+
+- **Ansible-Config**
+  - New yaml format for config
+  - Extend the ability of the current config system by adding creating an ansible-config command and add the following:
+
+    - Dump existing config settings
+    - Update / write a config entry
+    - Show available options (ini entry, yaml, env var, etc)
+
+  - Proposal found in ansible/proposals issue `#35 <https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/35>`_.
+  - Initial PR of code found in ansible/ansible PR `#12797 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/12797>`_.
+
+- **Inventory Overhaul**
+
+  - Current inventory is overtly complex, non modular and mostly still a legacy from inception. We also want to add a common set of features to most inventory sources but are hampered by the current code base.
+  - Proposal found in ansible/proposals issue `#41 <https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/41>`_.
+
+- **Facts Refreshening**
+
+  - Make setup.py/facts more pluggable
+  - Fact gathering policy finer grained
+
+- **Cloud Provider Support**
+
+  - Focus on pull requests for various modules
+  - Triage existing merges
+
+- **Contributor Quality of Life**
+
+  - More bot improvements!
