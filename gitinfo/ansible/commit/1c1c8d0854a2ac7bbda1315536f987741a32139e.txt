   - Two environment variables can be used, DO_API_KEY and DO_API_TOKEN. They both refer to the v2 token.

+  - As of Ansible 1.9.5 and 2.0, Version 2 of the DigitalOcean API is used, this removes C(client_id) and C(api_key) options in favor of C(api_token).
+  - If you are running Ansible 1.9.4 or earlier you might not be able to use the included version of this module as the API version used has been retired.
