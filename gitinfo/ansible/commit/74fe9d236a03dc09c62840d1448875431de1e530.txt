    Need to cleanup the code before we can enable this test.

+# * private attributes of ourself are okay: self._private.
+# * Private attributes of other objects are not: self.other._private

+
+# Currently the code has many places where we're violating this test so we need
+# to clean up the code before we can enable this.  Maybe we'll need to
+# selectively blacklist modules so that we can work on this a piece at a time.
+#
+# Also need to implement whitelist for certain things like bundled libraries
+# that violate this.
