    Skip non-management Packet IP addresses (#48168)
    
    Non-management (elastic) IP addresses require manual configuration on
    the host as described in https://help.packet.net/article/54-elastic-ips.
    Skip those so that only the automatically configured management
    addresses are used. Otherwise, a non-routable address may be returned in
    the inventory.
