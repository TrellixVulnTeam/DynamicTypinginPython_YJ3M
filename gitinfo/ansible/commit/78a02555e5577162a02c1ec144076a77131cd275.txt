+## 2.1.2 "The Song Remains the Same" - 09-29-2016
+
+###Minor Changes:
+* Fixed a bug related to creation of retry files (#17456)
+* Fixed a bug in the way include params are used when an include task is dynamic (#17064)
+* Fixed a bug related to including blocks in an include task (#15963)
+* Fixed a bug related to the use of hostvars internally when creating the connection plugin. This prevents things like variables using lookups from being evaluated unnecessarily (#17024)
+* Fixed a bug where using a variable containing a list for the `hosts` of a play resulted in an list of lists (#16583)
+* Fixed a bug where integer values would cause an error if a module param was of type `float` (no issue)
+* Fixed a bug with net_template failing if src was not specified (#17726)
+* Fixed a bug in "ansible-galaxy import" (#17417)
+* Fixed a bug in which INI files incorrectly treated a hosts range as a section header (#15331)
+* Fixed a bug in which the max_fail_percentage calculation erroneously caused a series of plays to stop executing (#15954)
+* Fixed a bug in which the task names were not properly templated (#16295)
+* Fixed a bug causing "squashed" loops (ie. yum, apt) to incorrectly report results (ansible-modules-core#4214)
+* Fixed several bugs related to includes:
+  - when including statically, make sure that all parents were also included statically (issue #16990)
+  - properly resolve nested static include paths
+  - print a message when a file is statically included
+* Fixed a bug in which module params expected to be float types were not converted from integers (only strings) (#17325)
+* Fixed a bug introduced by static includes in 2.1, which prevented notifications from going to the "top level" handler name.
+* Fixed a bug where a group_vars or host_vars directory in the current working directory would be used (and would take precedence) over those in the inventory and/or playbook directory.
+* Fixed a bug which could occur when the result of an async task did not parse as valid JSON.
+* (re)-allowed the use of ansible_python_interpreter lines with more than one argument.
+* Fixed several bugs related to the creation of the implicit localhost in inventory.
+* Fixed a bug related to an unspecified number of retries when using until.
+* Fixed a race-condition bug when creating temp directories before the worker process is forked.
+* Fix a bug with async's poll keyword not making use of ansible_python_interpreter to run (and thus breaking when /usr/bin/python is not present on the remote machine.)
+* Fix a bug where hosts that started with a range in inventory were being treated as an invalid section header.
+
+Module fixes:
+* Fixed a bug where the temporary CA files created by the module helper code were not being deleted properly in some situations (#17073)
+* Fixed many bugs in the unarchive module
+* Fixes for module ec2:
+  - Fixed a bug related to source_dest_check when used with non-vpc instances (core#3243)
+  - Fixed a bug in ec2 where instances were not powering of when referenced via tags only (core#4765)
+  - Fixed a bug where instances with multiple interfaces were not powering up/down correctly (core#3234)
+* Fixes for module get_url:
+  - Fixed a bug in get_url module to force a download if there is a checksum mismatch regardless of the last modified time (core#4262)
+  - Fixed a bug in get_url module to properly process FTP results (core#3661 and core#4601)
+* Fixed a bug in win_user related to users with disabled accounts/expired passwords (core#4369)
+* ini_file:
+  - Fixed a bug where option lines are now inserted before blank lines.
+  - Fixed a bug where leading whitespace prevented matches on options.
+* Fixed a bug in iam_cert when dup_ok is used as a string.
+* Fixed a bug in postgresql_db related to the changed logic when state=absent.
+* Fixed a bug where single_transaction and quick were not passed into db_dump for the mysql_db module.
+* Fixed a bug where the fetch module was not idempotent when retrieving the target of a symlink.
+* Many minor fixes for bugs in extras modules.
+
+###Deprecations:
+
+* Deprecated the use of `_fixup_perms`. Use `_fixup_perms2` instead.
+  This change only impacts custom action plugins using `_fixup_perms`.
+
+###Incompatible Changes:
+
+* Use of `_fixup_perms` with `recursive=True` (the default) is no longer supported.
+  Custom action plugins using `_fixup_perms` will require changes unless they already use `recursive=False`.
+  Use `_fixup_perms2` if support for previous releases is not required.
+  Otherwise use `_fixup_perms` with `recursive=False`.
