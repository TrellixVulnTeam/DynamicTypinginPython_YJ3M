+Ignoring Unreachable Host Errors
+````````````````````````````````````````
+
+.. versionadded:: 2.7
+
+You may ignore task failure due to the host instance being 'UNREACHABLE' with the ``ignore_unreachable`` keyword.
+Note that task errors are what's being ignored, not the unreachable host.
+
+Here's an example explaining the behavior for an unreachable host at the task level::
+
+    - name: this executes, fails, and the failure is ignored
+      command: /bin/true
+      ignore_unreachable: yes
+
+    - name: this executes, fails, and ends the play for this host
+      command: /bin/true
+
+And at the playbook level::
+
+    - hosts: all
+      ignore_unreachable: yes
+      tasks:
+      - name: this executes, fails, and the failure is ignored
+        command: /bin/true
+
+      - name: this executes, fails, and ends the play for this host
+        command: /bin/true
+        ignore_unreachable: no
