    Misc docs fixes
    
    * Revise and link inline to the lists of modules
    
    * Fix jinja2 objects.inv fallback path
    
    * Fix bolding of deprecation marker
    
    * Change module_support to link to lists via :doc:
      That links to the top of the page instead of a section.
    
    * Add a short text for each list of maintained modules
    * Change maintenance info to only display on core and network modules
