 1.3.2 "Top of the World" (reprise) - September 19th, 2013
 
 Multiple accelerate mode fixes:
-Make packet reception less greedy, so multiple frames of data are not consumed by one call.
-Adding two timeout values (one for connection and one for data reception timeout).
-Added keepalive packets, so async mode is no longer required for long-running tasks.
-Modified accelerate daemon to use the verbose logging level of the ansible command that started it.
-Fixed bug where accelerate would not work in check-mode.
-Added a -vvvv level, which will show SSH client debugging information in the event of a failure.
-Fixed bug in apt_repository module where the repository cache was not being updated.
-Fixed bug where "too many open files" errors would be encountered due to pseudo TTY's not being closed properly.
