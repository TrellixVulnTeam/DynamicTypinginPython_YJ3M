+Core Committers will review all modules becoming Curated.  Core Committers will review proposed changes to existing Curated modules once the community maintainers of the module have approved the changes. Core committers will also ensure that any issues that arise due to Ansible engine changes will be remediated.
 Also, it is strongly recommended (but not presently required) for these types of modules to have unit tests.
 
 These modules are currently shipped with Ansible, but might be shipped separately in the future.
