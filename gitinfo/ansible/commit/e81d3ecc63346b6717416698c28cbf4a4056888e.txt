+Rebase Request
+==============
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
+
+It looks like the code underneath has changed since this was submitted.  Can you take care of rebasing this for us?
+
+   * You should be able to run "git rebase" against this branch to bring it up to date
+   * Resolve any merge conflicts and test changes
+   * Push to the same branch and github should update the pull request automatically.
+
+Just as a quick reminder of things, this is a really busy project.  We have over 800 contributors and to manage the queue effectively
+we assign things a priority between P1 (highest) and P5.  We'd like to thank you very much for your time!  
+We'll work things in priority order, so just wanted you to be aware of the queue and know we haven't forgot about you!
+
+We will definitely see your comments on this issue when reading this ticket, but may not be able to reply promptly.  You may also wish to join one of our two mailing lists
+which is very active:
+
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project - for user questions, tips, and tricks
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for strategy, future planning, and questions about writing code
+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
+
