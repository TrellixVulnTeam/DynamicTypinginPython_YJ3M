 Documenting Your Module

+=======================

 The online module documentation is generated from the modules themselves.
 As the module documentation is generated from documentation strings contained in the modules, all modules included with Ansible must have a ``DOCUMENTATION`` string.
@@ -10,9 +12,100 @@ which conforms to the schema defined below. You may find it easier to
 start writing your ``DOCUMENTATION`` string in an editor with YAML
 syntax highlighting before you include it in your Python file.
 
+All modules must have the following sections defined in this order:
+
+1. ANSIBLE_METADATA
+2. DOCUMENTATION
+3. EXAMPLES
+4. RETURNS
+5. Python imports
+
+.. note:: Why don't the imports go first?
+
+  Keen Python programmers may notice that contrary to PEP8's advice we don't put ``imports`` at the top of the file. This is because the ``ANSIBLE_METADATA`` through ``RETURNS`` sections are not used by the module code itself; they are essentially extra docstrings for the file. The imports are placed after these special variables for the same reason as PEP8 puts the imports after the introductory comments and docstrings. This keeps the active parts of the code together and the pieces which are purely informational apart. The decision to exclude E402 is based on readability (which is what PEP8 is about). Documentation strings in a module are much more similar to module level docstrings, than code, and are never utilized by the module itself. Placing the imports below this documentation and closer to the code, consolidates and groups all related code in a congruent manner to improve readability, debugging and understanding.
+
+.. warning:: Why do some modules have imports at the bottom of the file?
+
+  If you look at some existing older modules, you may find imports at the bottom of the file. Do not copy that idiom into new modules as it is a historical oddity due to how modules used to be combined with libraries. Over time we're moving the imports to be in their proper place.

+
+ANSIBLE_METADATA Block
+----------------------
+
+ANSIBLE_METADATA contains information about the module for use by other tools. At the moment, it informs other tools which type of maintainer the module has and to what degree users can rely on a module's behaviour remaining the same over time.
+
+For new modules, the following block can be simply added into your module::
+
+   ANSIBLE_METADATA = {'status': ['preview'],
+                       'supported_by': 'community',
+                       'version': '1.0'}
+
+.. warning:: version field
+
+   This is the version of the ``ANSIBLE_METADATA`` schema, *not* the version of the module.
+
+.. warning::
+
+   Promoting a module's ``status`` or ``supported_by`` status should only be done by members of the Ansible Core Team.

+Structure
+`````````
+
+Format::
+
+  ANSIBLE_METADATA = {
+      'version': '1.0',
+      'supported_by': 'core|community|core_curated',
+      'status': ['stableinterface|preview|deprecated|removed']
+  }
+
+Fields
+``````
+
+:version: An “X.Y” formatted string. X and Y are integers which
+   define the metadata format version. Modules shipped with Ansible are
+   tied to an Ansible release, so we will only ship with a single version
+   of the metadata. We’ll increment Y if we add fields or legal values
+   to an existing field. We’ll increment X if we remove fields or values
+   or change the type or meaning of a field.
+:supported_by: This field records who supports the module.
+   Default value is community. Values are:
+
+   :core: Maintained by the Ansible core team. Core team will fix
+      bugs, add new features, and review PRs.
+   :community: This module is maintained by the community at large,
+      which is responsible for fixing bugs, adding new features, and
+      reviewing changes.
+   :unmaintained: This module currently needs a new community
+      contributor to help maintain it.
+   :committer: Committers to the Ansible repository are the
+      gatekeepers for this module. They will review PRs from the community
+      before merging but might not generate fixes and code for new features
+      on their own.
+
+:status: This field records information about the module that is
+   important to the end user. It’s a list of strings. The default value
+   is a single element list [“preview”]. The following strings are valid
+   statuses and have the following meanings:
+
+   :stableinterface: This means that the module’s parameters are
+      stable. Every effort will be made not to remove parameters or change
+      their meaning. It is not a rating of the module’s code quality.
+   :preview: This module is a tech preview. This means it may be
+      unstable, the parameters may change, or it may require libraries or
+      web services that are themselves subject to incompatible changes.
+   :deprecated: This module is deprecated and will no longer be
+      available in a future release.
+   :removed: This module is not present in the release. A stub is
+      kept so that documentation can be built. The documentation helps
+      users port from the removed module to new modules.
