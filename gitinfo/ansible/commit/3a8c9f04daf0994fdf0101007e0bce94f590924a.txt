    apt: do not consider not-removed and not-upgraded packages as changes.
    
    If one pins a package and does a 'apt-get dist-upgrade' then the
    output looks like:
    
        # apt-get dist-upgrade
        Reading package lists... Done
        Building dependency tree
        Reading state information... Done
        Calculating upgrade... Done
        The following packages have been kept back:
          cassandra
        0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
    
    The check for any changes made should only be on the 'upgraded' and
    'newly installed' values and not include the 'to remove' and 'not
    upgraded' values.
