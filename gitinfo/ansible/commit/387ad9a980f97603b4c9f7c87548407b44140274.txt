 * removed 'package' from default squash actions as not all package managers support it and it creates errors when using loops,
   any user can add back via config options if they don't use those package managers or othewise avoid the errors.
 * Blocks can now have a `name` field, to aid in playbook readability.
+* default strategy is now configurable via ansible.cfg or environment variable.
 
 ###Deprecations:
 * Specifying --tags (or --skip-tags) multiple times on the command line
