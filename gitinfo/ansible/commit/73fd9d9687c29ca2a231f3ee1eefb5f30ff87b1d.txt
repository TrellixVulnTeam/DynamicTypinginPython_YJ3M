 Highlighted new features:
 
-* new /etc/ansible/facts.d allows JSON or INI style facts to be provided from the remote node, and supports executable fact programs in this dir. Files must end in *.fact.
-* ability to make undefined template variables raise errors, see ansible.cfg
-* (DOCS PENDING) sudo: True/False and sudo_user: True/False can set at include and role level
-* added changed_when: (expression) which allows overriding whether a result is changed or not, can work with registered expressions.
-* --extra-vars can now take a file as input "-e @filename"

 * external inventory scripts may now return host variables in one pass, which allows them to be much more efficient for large numbers of hosts
-* if --forks exceeds the numbers of hosts, it will be automatically reduced, set forks to 0 and you get "as many forks as I have hosts" out of the box.
-* enabling error_on_undefined_vars by default, which will make errors in playbooks more obvious
-* role dependencies -- be able to have one role pull in another, with parameters of its own.
