    Clarify uncertain nature of tracebacks on Python 2 (#42513)
    
    * Only add exception/traceback on Python 3
    
    On Python 2 the traceback could be any exception from the stack frame
    and likely unrelated to the fail_json call.
    
    On Python 3 the traceback is cleared outside any exception frame, so the
    call always returns the most inner traceback (if any), and therefor is
    most likely related to the fail_json call.
    
    * Add uncertainty to traceback on Python 2
    
    On Python 2 the last exception in the stack frame is being returned,
    this could be unrelated to the actual error, especially if fail_json()
    is called outside an except: block.
