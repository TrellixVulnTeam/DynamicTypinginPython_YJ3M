    cover most of the ground users need.

       - This module allows you to specify the name of the file directly without any other options.
 notes:
   - This is a core feature of Ansible, rather than a module, and cannot be overridden like a module.
-  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
+  - Include has some unintuitive behaviours depending on if it is running in a static or dynamic in play or in playbook context,
