 This guide is intended for network engineers using Ansible for the first time. If you understand networks but have never used Ansible, work through the guide from start to finish.
 
 This guide is also useful for experienced Ansible users automating network tasks for the first time. You can use Ansible commands, playbooks and modules to configure hubs, switches, routers, bridges and other network devices. But network modules are different from Linux/Unix and Windows modules, and you must understand some network-specific concepts to succeed. If you understand Ansible but have never automated a network task, start with the second section.

 Ansible for Network Automation
 ******************************
 
-Introduction
-============
-
 Ansible Network modules extend the benefits of simple, powerful, agentless automation to network administrators and teams. Ansible Network modules can configure your network stack, test and validate existing network state, and discover and correct network configuration drift.
 
-If you're new to Ansible, or new to using Ansible for network management, start with the Getting Started Guide.
+If you're new to Ansible, or new to using Ansible for network management, start with :ref:`network_getting_started`. If you are already familiar with network automation with Ansible, see :ref:`network_advanced`.
 
 For documentation on using a particular network module, consult the :ref:`list of all network modules<network_modules>`. Some network modules are maintained by the Ansible community - here's a list of :ref:`network modules maintained by the Ansible Network Team<network_supported>`.
