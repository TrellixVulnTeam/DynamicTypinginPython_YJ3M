    Clarify the port value always defaults to 3306
    
    While the [boto docs](https://github.com/boto/boto/blob/develop/boto/rds/__init__.py#L253) make it seem like the default value of `port` is changed depending on the engine chosen, AFAICT from looking at the code the default value is never changed from 3306.
    
    I think the docs are intended to be read as "the default value used by <engine> is <port> so you should change `port` to that value".
    
    If you don't specify the port value and chose the database engine as PostgreSQL you'll end up with a PostgreSQL instance running on port 3306.
