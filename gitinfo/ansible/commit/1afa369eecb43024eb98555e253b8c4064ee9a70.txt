    Move the Github issue and pull-request templates to .github
    
    In essence, most people do not need to use the templates directly,
    getting them out of the way increases the signal-to-noise ratio of
    the root directory. Direct people to what they are looking for.

diff --git a/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md b/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
similarity index 100%
rename from ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
rename to .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
diff --git a/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md b/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
similarity index 100%
rename from PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
rename to .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
