    Fix Unexpected Exception: global name 'os' is not defined
    
    I inadvertently introduced it in
    ca826508d992f99ab6cba75d03a34b804448dfef and didn't notice, because
    there are no unit tests for playbook_executor.py.  Sorry!
    
    (The "from ansible.errors import *" was used *only* to get the 'os'
    module, which makes go "what?")
