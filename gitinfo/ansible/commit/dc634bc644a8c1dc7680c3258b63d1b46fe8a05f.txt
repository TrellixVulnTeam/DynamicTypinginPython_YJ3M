    Name appears to be a required parameter
    
    As far as I can tell, `name` is a required parameter.  The guard test at (now) line 458 says you need name if `state == present` and at 464 if `state != present`, although that's not quite as clear.  Each of the code paths at 485 - 495 pass the name param through to `add_job`, `update_job` and `remove_job`, and the actual _update_job method earlier seems to require it too.  However I don't really know python so I may be wrong, but I can't see the circumstances when `name` is not required.
