 Design Principles
 =================
 
-    * Dead simple setup
-    * Super fast & parallel by default
-    * No server or client daemons; use existing SSHd
-    * No additional software required on client boxes
-    * Modules can be written in ANY language
-    * Awesome API for creating very powerful distributed scripts
-    * Be usable as non-root
-    * Create the easiest config management system to use, ever.

 Requirements
 ============
 
 For the server the tool is running from, *only*:
 
-    * paramiko
-    * python 2.6 (or the 2.4/2.5 backport of the multiprocessing module)
-    * PyYAML (only if using playbooks)

 Optional -- If you want to push templates, the nodes need a template library,
 which for bonus points you can install with ansible!  Easy enough.
