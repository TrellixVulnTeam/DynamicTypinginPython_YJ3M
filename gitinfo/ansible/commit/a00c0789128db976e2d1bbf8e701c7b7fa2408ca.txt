    Add support for repos with svn:externals files
    
    When a SVN repository has some svn:externals properties, files will be
    reported with the X attribute, and lines will be added at the end to
    list externals statuses with a text looking like
    "Performing status on external item at ....".
    Such lines were counted as a local modification by the regex, and the
    module returned a change, even though they were none.
    
    To have a clean (and parsable) "svn status" output, it is recommended
    to use the --quiet option. The externals will only appear if they have
    been modified. With this option on, it seems even safer to consider
    there are local modifications when "svn status" outputs anything.
