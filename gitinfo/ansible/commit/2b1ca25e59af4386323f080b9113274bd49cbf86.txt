+Macro development: roadmaps, releases, and projects
+===================================================
 
-The Ansible Core team provides a road map for each upcoming release. These road maps can be found :ref:`here <roadmaps>`.
+If you want to follow the conversation about what features will be added to Ansible for upcoming releases and what bugs are being fixed, you can watch these resources:
 
-.. Roadmaps are User-oriented.  We should also list the Roadmap Projects and the Blocker Bug
-   Projects here
+* the :ref:`roadmaps`
+* the :ref:`Ansible Release Schedule <release_and_maintenance>`
+* various GitHub `projects <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/projects>`_ - for example:
 
-.. How the actual release schedule, slipping, etc relates to (release_and_maintenance.rst) probably
-   also belongs here somewhere

-Pull Requests
-=============
-
-Ansible accepts code via **pull requests** ("PRs" for short). GitHub provides a great overview of `how the pull request process works <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ in general.
-
-Because Ansible receives many pull requests, we use an automated process to help us through the process of reviewing and merging pull requests. That process is managed by **Ansibullbot**.
-
-Backport Pull Request Process
------------------------------
-
-After the pull request submitted to Ansible for the ``devel`` branch is
-accepted and merged, the following instructions will help you create a
-pull request to backport the change to a previous stable branch.
-
-We do **not** backport features.
-
-.. note::
-
-   These instructions assume that:
-
-    * ``stable-2.7`` is the targeted release branch for the backport
-    * ``https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git`` is configured as a
-      ``git remote`` named ``upstream``. If you do not use
-      a ``git remote`` named ``upstream``, adjust the instructions accordingly.
-    * ``https://github.com/<yourgithubaccount>/ansible.git``
-      is configured as a ``git remote`` named ``origin``. If you do not use
-      a ``git remote`` named ``origin``, adjust the instructions accordingly.
-
-#. Prepare your devel, stable, and feature branches:
-
-   ::
-
-       git fetch upstream
-       git checkout -b backport/2.7/[PR_NUMBER_FROM_DEVEL] upstream/stable-2.7
-
-#. Cherry pick the relevant commit SHA from the devel branch into your feature
-   branch, handling merge conflicts as necessary:
-
-   ::
-
-       git cherry-pick -x [SHA_FROM_DEVEL]
-
-#. Add a :ref:`changelog fragment <changelogs_how_to>` for the change, and commit it.
-
-#. Push your feature branch to your fork on GitHub:
-
-   ::
-
-       git push origin backport/2.7/[PR_NUMBER_FROM_DEVEL]
-
-#. Submit the pull request for ``backport/2.7/[PR_NUMBER_FROM_DEVEL]``
-   against the ``stable-2.7`` branch
+Micro development: the lifecycle of a PR
+========================================
 
-#. The Release Manager will decide whether to merge the backport PR before
-   the next minor release. There isn't any need to follow up. Just ensure that the automated
-   tests (CI) are green.
-
-.. note::
-
-    The choice to use ``backport/2.7/[PR_NUMBER_FROM_DEVEL]`` as the
-    name for the feature branch is somewhat arbitrary, but conveys meaning
-    about the purpose of that branch. It is not required to use this format,
-    but it can be helpful, especially when making multiple backport PRs for
-    multiple stable branches.
-
-.. note::
-
-    If you prefer, you can use CPython's cherry-picker tool to backport commits
-    from devel to stable branches in Ansible. Take a look at the `cherry-picker
-    documentation <https://pypi.org/p/cherry-picker#cherry-picking>`_ for
-    details on installing, configuring, and using it.

+Human PR review
+---------------
+
+After Ansibot reviews the PR and applies labels, the PR is ready for human review. The most likely reviewers for any PR are the maintainers for the module that PR modifies.

+Each module has at least one assigned :ref:`maintainer <maintainers>`, listed in the `BOTMETA.yml <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml>`_ file.

+The maintainer's job is to review PRs that affect that module and decide whether they should be merged (``shipit``) or revised (``needs_revision``). We'd like to have at least one community maintainer for every module. If a module has no community maintainers assigned, the maintainer is listed as ``$team_ansible``.

+
+
+Making your PR merge-worthy
+===========================
+
+We don't merge every PR. Here are some tips for making your PR useful, attractive, and merge-worthy.
+
+.. _community_changelogs:
+
+Changelogs
+----------
+
+Changelogs help users and developers keep up with changes to Ansible.
+Ansible builds a changelog for each release from fragments. You **must** add a changelog fragment to any PR that changes functionality or fixes a bug.
+You don't have to add a changelog fragment for PRs that add new
+modules and plugins, because our tooling does that for you automatically.
+
+We build short summary changelogs for minor releases as well as for major releases. If you backport a bugfix, include a changelog fragment with the backport PR.
+
+.. _changelogs_how_to:
+
+Creating a changelog fragment
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+A basic changelog fragment is a ``.yaml`` file placed in the
+``changelogs/fragments/`` directory.  Each file contains a yaml dict with
+keys like ``bugfixes`` or ``major_changes`` followed by a list of
+changelog entries of bugfixes or features.  Each changelog entry is
+rst embedded inside of the yaml file which means that certain
+constructs would need to be escaped so they can be interpreted by rst
+and not by yaml (or escaped for both yaml and rst if that's your
+desire).  Each PR **must** use a new fragment file rather than adding to
+an existing one, so we can trace the change back to the PR that introduced it.
+
+To create a changelog entry, create a new file with a unique name in the ``changelogs/fragments/`` directory. The file name should include the PR number and a description of the change. It must end with the file extension ``.yaml``. For example: ``40696-user-backup-shadow-file.yaml``
+
+A single changelog fragment may contain multiple sections but most will only contain one section.
+The toplevel keys (bugfixes, major_changes, etc) are defined in the
+`config file <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/changelogs/config.yaml>` for our release note tool. Here are the valid sections and a description of each:
+
+**major_changes**
+    Major changes to Ansible itself. Generally does not include module or plugin changes.
+
+**minor_changes**
+  Minor changes to Ansible, modules, or plugins. This includes new features, new parameters added to modules, or behavior changes to existing parameters.
+
+**deprecated_features**
+  Features that have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in a future release.
+
+**removed_features**
+  Features that were previously deprecated and are now removed.
+
+**bugfixes**
+  Fixes that resolve issues. If there is a specific issue related to this bugfix, add a link in the changelog entry.
+
+**known_issues**
+  Known issues that are currently not fixed or will not be fixed.
+
+Most changelog entries will be ``bugfixes`` or ``minor_changes``. When writing a changelog entry that pertains to a particular module, start the entry with ``- [module name] -`` and include a link to the related issue if one exists.
+
+Here are some examples:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+  bugfixes:
+    - win_updates - fixed issue where running win_updates on async fails without any error
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+  minor_changes:
+    - lineinfile - add warning when using an empty regexp (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/29443)
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+  bugfixes:
+    - copy module - The copy module was attempting to change the mode of files for
+   remote_src=True even if mode was not set as a parameter.  This failed on
+   filesystems which do not have permission bits.
+
+You can find more example changelog fragments in the `changelog directory <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/stable-2.6/changelogs/fragments>`_ for the 2.6 release. You can also find documentation of the format, including hints on embedding rst in the yaml, in the `reno documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/user/usage.html#editing-a-release-note>`_.
+
+Once you've written the changelog fragment for your PR, commit the file and include it with the pull request.
+
+
+Backporting merged PRs
+======================
+
+All Ansible PRs must be merged to the ``devel`` branch first.
+After a pull request has been accepted and merged to the ``devel`` branch, the following instructions will help you create a
+pull request to backport the change to a previous stable branch.
+
+We do **not** backport features.
+
+.. note::

+
+    * ``stable-2.7`` is the targeted release branch for the backport
+    * ``https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git`` is configured as a
+      ``git remote`` named ``upstream``. If you do not use
+      a ``git remote`` named ``upstream``, adjust the instructions accordingly.

+      is configured as a ``git remote`` named ``origin``. If you do not use

+

+
+   ::

+       git fetch upstream
+       git checkout -b backport/2.7/[PR_NUMBER_FROM_DEVEL] upstream/stable-2.7
+
+#. Cherry pick the relevant commit SHA from the devel branch into your feature
+   branch, handling merge conflicts as necessary:
