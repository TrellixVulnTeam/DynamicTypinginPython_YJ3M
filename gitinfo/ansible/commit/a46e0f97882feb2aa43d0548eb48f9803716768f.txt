       - shell: echo "only on Red Hat 6, derivatives, and later"
         when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" and ansible_lsb.major_release|int >= 6
 
+Note the above example requires the lsb_release package on the target host in order to return the ansible_lsb.major_release fact.

 Variables defined in the playbooks or inventory can also be used.
 
+An example may be the execution of a task based on a variable's boolean value::

+      epic: true
+
+Then a conditional execution with action on the boolean value of epic being True::
+
+    tasks:
+        - shell: echo "This certainly is epic!"
+          when: epic

+    tasks:
+        - shell: echo "This certainly isn't epic!"
+          when: not epic

 If a required variable has not been set, you can skip or fail using Jinja2's
 `defined` test. For example::
