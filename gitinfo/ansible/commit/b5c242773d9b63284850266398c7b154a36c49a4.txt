-
-* A good name for the bug ("Foo module raises exception when xyz=glork is used", vs "foo doesn't work")
-* A succinct description of the problem
-* What version of ansible you are using (ansible --version)
-* Steps to reproduce the problem, including commands or playbook snippets as relevant
-* Expected results
-* Actual results, and as full/complete output as possible

 Do not use the issue tracker for "how do I do this" type questions.  These are great candidates
 for IRC or the mailing list instead where things are likely to be more of a discussion.
