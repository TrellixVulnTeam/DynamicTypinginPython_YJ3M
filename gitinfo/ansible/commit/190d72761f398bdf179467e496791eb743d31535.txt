 0.6 "Cabo" ------------ pending
 
+playbooks:
+
+* support to tag tasks and includes and use --tags in playbook CLI 
+* playbooks can now include other playbooks (example/playbooks/nested_playbooks.yml)
+* vars_files now usable with with_items, provided file paths don't contain host specific facts
+* error reporting if with_items value is unbound
+* with_items no longer creates lots of tasks, creates one task that makes multiple calls
+* can use host_specific facts inside with_items (see above)
+* at the top level of a playbook, set 'gather_facts: False' to skip fact gathering
+* first_available_file and with_items used together will now raise an error
+* to catch typos, like 'var' for 'vars', playbooks and tasks now yell on invalid parameters
+* automatically load (directory_of_inventory_file)/group_vars/groupname and /host_vars/hostname in vars_files
+* playbook is now colorized, set ANSIBLE_NOCOLOR=1 if you do not like this, does not colorize if not a TTY
+* hostvars now preserved between plays (regression in 0.5 from 0.4), useful for sharing vars in multinode configs
+
+inventory:
+
 * inventory file can use a line of the form base[beg:end]tail to define a
   set of hosts, where [beg:end] defines a numerical range. 'beg' can be a
   a string padded with zero(s) to the left. If so provided, it acts as
   a formatting hint during hostname expansion. The hint must be confirmed
   by having an 'end' that has the same length as 'beg'
 * groups variable available as a hash to return the hosts in each group name
+* in YAML inventory, hosts can list their groups in inverted order now also (see tests/yaml_hosts)
+* YAML inventory is deprecated and will be removed in 0.7
+* ec2 inventory script
+* support ranges of hosts in the host file
+
+modules:
+
 * fetch module now does not fail a system when requesting file paths (ex: logs) that don't exist
 * apt module now takes an optional install-recommends=yes|no (default yes)
 * fixes to the return codes of the copy module
 * copy module takes a remote md5sum to avoid large file transfer
-* when sudoing to root, still use /etc/ansible/setup as the metadata path, as if root
-* support to tag tasks and includes and use --tags in playbook CLI 
 * various user and group module fixes (error handling, etc)
 * apt module now takes an optional force parameter
 * slightly better psychic service status handling for the service module
-* cowsay support on Ubuntu
-* playbooks can now include other playbooks (example/playbooks/nested_playbooks.yml)
-* paramiko is now only imported if needed when running from source checkout
 * fetch module fixes for SSH connection type
-* modules now consistently all take yes/no for boolean parameters (some accepted true/false)
-* in YAML inventory, hosts can list their groups in inverted order now also (see tests/yaml_hosts)
+* modules now consistently all take yes/no for boolean parameters (and DWIM on true/false/1/0/y/n/etc)
 * setup module no longer saves to disk, template module now only used in playbooks
 * setup module no longer needs to run twice per playbook
-* vars_files now usable with with_items, provided file paths don't contain host specific facts
-* error reporting if with_items value is unbound
-* with_items no longer creates lots of tasks, creates one task that makes multiple calls
-* can use host_specific facts inside with_items (see above)
-* at the top level of a playbook, set 'gather_facts: False' to skip fact gathering
-* first_available_file and with_items used together will now raise an error
-* ec2 inventory script
-* mount module
 * apt module now passes DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
-* to catch typos, like 'var' for 'vars', playbooks and tasks now yell on invalid parameters
-* automatically load (directory_of_inventory_file)/group_vars/groupname and /host_vars/hostname in vars_files
+* mount module (manages active mounts + fstab)
 * setup module fixes if no ipv6 support
 * internals: template in common module boilerplate, also causes less SSH operations when used
 * git module fixes
-* various ssh connection fixes for old Ubuntu clients
 * setup module overhaul, more modular 
 * minor caching logic added to inventory to reduce hammering of inventory scripts.
-* ./hacking/test-module now supports options like ansible takes and has a debugger mode
-* playbook is now colorized, set ANSIBLE_NOCOLOR=1 if you do not like this, does not colorize if not a TTY
-* support ranges of hosts in the host file
-* hostvars now preserved between plays (regression in 0.5 from 0.4), useful for sharing vars in multinode configs
 * MySQL and PostgreSQL modules for user and db management
 * vars_prompt now supports private password entry (see examples/playbooks/prompts.yml)
