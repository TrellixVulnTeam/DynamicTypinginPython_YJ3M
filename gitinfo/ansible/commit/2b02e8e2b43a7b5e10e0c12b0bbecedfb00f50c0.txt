commit 2b02e8e2b43a7b5e10e0c12b0bbecedfb00f50c0

    Allow certain base attributes to be used as role params
    
    Role definitions typically require params to be different from those
    which are specified as FieldAttributes on the playbook classes used
    for roles, however a certain subset should be allowed (typically those
    used for connection stuff).
    
    Fixes #14095
