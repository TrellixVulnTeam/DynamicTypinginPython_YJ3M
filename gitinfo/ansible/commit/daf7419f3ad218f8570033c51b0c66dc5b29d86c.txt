-   Ansible does not run with Python 3.
+.. note::
+
+   Python 3 is a slightly different language than Python 2 and most python programs (including
+   Ansible) are not
+   switching over yet.  However, some Linux distributions (Gentoo, Arch) may not have a 
+   Python 2.X interpreter installed by default.  On those systems, you should install one, and set
+   the 'ansible_python_interpreter' variable in inventory to point at your 2.X python.  Distributions
+   like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu all have a 2.X interpreter installed
+   by default and this does not apply to those distributions.  This is also true of nearly all
+   Unix systems.  If you need to bootstrap these remote systems by installing Python 2.X, 
+   using the 'raw' module will be able to do it remotely.
