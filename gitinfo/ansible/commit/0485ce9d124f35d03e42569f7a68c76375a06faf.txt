 Using ``collections`` in roles
 ------------------------------
 
-Within a role, you can control which collections Ansible searches for the tasks inside the role using the ``collections`` keyword in the role's ``metadata/main.yml``. Ansible will use the collections list defined inside the role even if the playbook that calls the role defines different collections in a separate ``collections`` keyword entry. Roles defined inside a collection always implicitly search their own collection first, so you don't need to use the ``collections`` keyword to access modules, actions, or other roles contained in the same collection.
