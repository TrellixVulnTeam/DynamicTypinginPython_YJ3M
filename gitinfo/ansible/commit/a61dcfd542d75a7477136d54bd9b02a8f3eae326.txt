    Mark `mariadb_replication` tests unsupported.
    
    Only one integration test target is supported per module. Since there is already a `mysql_replication` integration test, the `mariadb_replication` tests will not execute for the same module.
    
    To avoid issues with tests not running on changes to the `mysql_replication` module and then failing after changes are made and all tests are executed, the test has been marked `unsupported` to prevent it from running in CI.
    
    To re-enable this test for CI it will need to be merged into the `mysql_replication` tests, which will require working around conflicts between the packages required by the two sets of tests.
