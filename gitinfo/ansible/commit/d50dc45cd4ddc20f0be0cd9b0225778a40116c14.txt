+When defining groups of groups in the static inventory file, the child groups
+must also be defined in the static inventory file, or ansible will return an
+error. If you want to define a static group of dynamic child groups, define
+the dynamic groups as empty in the static inventory file. For example::
+
+    [tag_Name_staging_foo]
+
+    [tag_Name_staging_bar]
+
+    [staging:children]
+    tag_Name_staging_foo
+    tag_Name_staging_bar
