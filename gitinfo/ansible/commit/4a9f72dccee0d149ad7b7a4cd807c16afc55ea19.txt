+
+* Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses
+  it if so, if not falls back to paramiko.
+* Host key checking is on by default.  Disable it if you like by adding host_key_checking=False in the [default]
+  section of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
+* Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key checking is on.  It is somewhat sluggish when doing this,
+  so switch to the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.
