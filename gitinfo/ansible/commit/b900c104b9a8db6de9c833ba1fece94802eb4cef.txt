 The username and branch at the end are the important parts, which will be turned into git commands as follows::
 
    git checkout -b testing_PRXXXX devel
    git pull https://github.com/someuser/ansible.git feature_branch_name
 
-The first command creates and switches to a new branch named testing_PRXXXX, where the XXXX is the actual issue number associated 
-with the pull request (for example, 1234). This branch is based on the devel branch. The second command pulls the new code from the 
-users feature branch into the newly created branch.

+Finding a Pull Request for Ansible Modules
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+Ansible modules are in separate repositories, which are managed as Git submodules. Here's a step by step process for checking out a PR for an Ansible extras module, for instance:
+
+1. git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
+2. cd ansible
+3. git submodule init
+4. git submodule update --recursive
+5. cd lib/ansible/modules/extras
+6. git fetch origin pull/1234/head:pr/1234
+7. git checkout pr/1234
+[ DO YOUR TESTING HERE ]
+8. cd /path/to/ansible/clone
+9. git submodule update --recursive
 
 For Those About To Test, We Salute You
