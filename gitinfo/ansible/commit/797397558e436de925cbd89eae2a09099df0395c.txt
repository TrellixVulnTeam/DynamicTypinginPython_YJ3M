 .. note::
     Certain files and folders are excluded when building the collection artifact. This is not currently configurable
     and is a work in progress so the collection artifact may contain files you would not wish to distribute.
+    This includes any files built with ``mazer`` so delete those from :file:`releases/` before you build your collection with ``ansible-galaxy``.  The current Galaxy maximum tarball size is 2 MB.
 
 This tarball is mainly intended to upload to Galaxy
 as a distribution method, but you can use it directly to install the collection on target systems.
