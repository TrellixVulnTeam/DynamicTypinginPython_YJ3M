+All software has bugs, and Ansible is no exception. When you find a bug, you can help tremendously by `telling us about it <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/reporting_bugs_and_features.rst>`.
 
+If you should discover that the bug you're trying to file already exists in an issue, you can help by verifying the behavior of the reported bug with a comment in that issue, or by reporting any additional information.
 
 Review and submit pull requests

+As you become more familiar with how Ansible works, you may be able to fix issues or develop new features yourself. If you think you've got a solution to a bug you've found in Ansible, or if you've got a new feature that you've written and would like to share with millions of Ansible users, read all about the `Ansible development process <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/development_process.rst>` to learn how to get your code accepted into Ansible.
+
+Another good way to help is to review pull requests that other Ansible users have submitted. The Ansible community keeps a full list of `open pull requests by file <https://ansible.sivel.net/byfile.html>`, so if there's a particular module or plug-in that particularly interests you, you can easily keep track of all the relevant new pull requests and provide testing or feedback. 
 
 Become a module maintainer
 --------------------------
 
+Once you've learned about the development process and have contributed code to a particular module, we encourage you to become a maintainer of that module. There are hundreds of different modules in Ansible, and the vast majority of them are written and maintained entirely by members of the Ansible community.
+
+To learn more about the responsibilities of being an Ansible module maintainer, please read our `module maintainer guidelines <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/maintainers.rst>`.
 
 Join a working group
 --------------------
 
+Working groups are a way for Ansible community members to self-organize around particular topics of interest. We have working groups around various topics. To join or create a working group, please read the `Ansible working group guidelines <https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md>`.

 Teach Ansible to others
 -----------------------
 
-https://github.com/ansible/lightbulb
+We're working on a standardized Ansible workshop called `Lightbulb <https://github.com/ansible/lightbulb>` that can provide a good hands-on introduction to Ansible usage and concepts. 
+
+Social media
+------------
+
+If you like Ansible and just want to spread the good word, feel free to share on your social media platform of choice, and let us know by using @ansible or #ansible. We'll be looking for you.
