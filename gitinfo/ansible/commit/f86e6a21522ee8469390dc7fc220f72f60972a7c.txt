+  - This module configures the timezone setting, both of the system clock and of the hardware clock. If you want to set up the NTP, use M(service) module.
   - It is recommended to restart C(crond) after changing the timezone, otherwise the jobs may run at the wrong time.
-  - On Linux it uses the C(timedatectl) command if available. Otherwise, it edits C(/etc/sysconfig/clock) or C(/etc/timezone) for the system clock, and uses the C(hwclock) command for the hardware clock.
-  - On SmartOS the C(sm-set-timezone) utility is used to set the zone timezone.
-  - "On *BSD, C(/etc/localtime) is modified."
+  - Several different tools are used depending on the OS/Distribution involved.
+    For Linux it can use C(timedatectl)  or edit C(/etc/sysconfig/clock) or C(/etc/timezone) andC(hwclock).
+    On SmartOS , C(sm-set-timezone), for *BSD, C(/etc/localtime) is modified.
+  - As of version 2.3 support was added for SmartOS and BSDs.
