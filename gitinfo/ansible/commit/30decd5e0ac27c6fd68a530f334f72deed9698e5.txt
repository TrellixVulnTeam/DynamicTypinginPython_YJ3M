 Host Inventory

-Once your nodes are spun up, you'll probably want to talk to them again.  The best way to handle his is to use the "rax" inventory plugin, which dynamically queries Rackspace Cloud and tells Ansible what nodes you have to manage.  You might want to use this even if you are spinning up Ansible via other tools, including the Rackspace Cloud user interface. The inventory plugin can be used to group resources by metadata, region, OS, etc.  Utilizing metadata is highly recommended in "rax" and can provide an easy way to sort between host groups and roles. If you don't want to use the ``rax.py`` dynamic inventory script, you could also still choose to manually manage your INI inventory file, though this is less recommended.

 In Ansible it is quite possible to use multiple dynamic inventory plugins along with INI file data.  Just put them in a common directory and be sure the scripts are chmod +x, and the INI-based ones are not.
