+Sometimes you'll want to include the content of a file directly into a playbook.  You can do so using a macro.  
+This syntax will remain in future versions, though we will also will provide ways to do this via lookup plugins (see "More Loops") as well.  What follows
+is an example using the authorized_key module, which requires the actual text of the SSH key as a parameter::
+
+    tasks:
+        - authorized_key name=$item key=$FILE(/keys/$user1)
+          with_items:
+             - pinky
+             - brain
+             - snowball
+
+The "$PIPE" macro works just like file, except you would feed it a command string instead.  It executes locally, not remotely, as does $FILE.
