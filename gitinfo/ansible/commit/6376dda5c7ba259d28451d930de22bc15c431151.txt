 This is dead code, it is here for convinience for those testing current devel so as to acertain if a bug was introduced in the v2 rewrite or was preexisitng in the 1.x codebase.
+Using this code should be equivalent of checking out the v1_last tag, which was devel at a point between 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 releases.
+The stable-1.9 is the maintenance branch for the 1.9.x code, which might continue to diverge from the v1/ tree as bugs get fixed.
