 Porting plugins
----------------
+===============
 
 In ansible-1.9.x, you would generally copy an existing plugin to create a new one. Simply implementing the methods and attributes that the caller of the plugin expected made it a plugin of that type. In ansible-2.0, most plugins are implemented by subclassing a base class for each plugin type. This way the custom plugin does not need to contain methods which are not customized.

+
+It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.
+

+
+.. contents:: Topics
+
+Playbook
+========
+
+Restructued async to work with action plugins
+---------------------------------------------
+
+In Ansible 2.2 (and possibly earlier) the `async:` keyword could not be used in conjunction with the action plugins such as `service`. This limitation has been removed in Ansible 2.3
+
+**NEW** In Ansible 2.3:
+
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    - name: Install nginx asynchronously
+      service:
+        name: nginx
+        state: restarted
+      async: 45
+
+
+OpenBSD version facts
+---------------------
+
+The `ansible_distribution_release` and `ansible_distribution_version` facts on OpenBSD hosts were reversed in Ansible 2.2 and earlier. This has been changed so that version has the numeric portion and release has the name of the release.
+
+**OLD** In Ansible 2.2 (and earlier)
+
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    "ansible_distribution": "OpenBSD"
+    "ansible_distribution_release": "6.0",
+    "ansible_distribution_version": "release",
+
+**NEW** In Ansible 2.3:
+
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    "ansible_distribution": "OpenBSD",
+    "ansible_distribution_release": "release",
+    "ansible_distribution_version": "6.0",
+
+
+Names Blocks
+------------
+
+Blocks can now have names, this allows you to avoid the ugly `# this block is for...` comments.
+
+
+**NEW** In Ansible 2.3:
+
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    - name: Block test case
+      hosts: localhost
+      tasks:
+       - name: Attempt to setup foo
+         block:
+           - debug: msg='I execute normally'
+           - command: /bin/false
+           - debug: msg='I never execute, cause ERROR!'
+         rescue:
+           - debug: msg='I caught an error'
+           - command: /bin/false
+           - debug: msg='I also never execute :-('
+         always:
+           - debug: msg="this always executes"
+
+
+Use of multiple tags
+--------------------
+
+Specifying ``--tags`` (or ``--skip-tags``) multiple times on the command line currently leads to the last specified tag overriding all the other specified tags. This behaviour is deprecated. In the future, if you specify --tags multiple times the tags will be merged together. From now on, using ``--tags`` multiple times on one command line will emit a deprecation warning. Setting the ``merge_multiple_cli_tags`` option to True in the ``ansible.cfg`` file will enable the new behaviour.
+
+In 2.4, the default will be to merge the tags. You can enable the old overwriting behavior via the config option.
+In 2.5, multiple ``--tags`` options will be merged with no way to go back to the old behaviour.
+
+
+Other caveats
+-------------
+
+Here are some rare cases that might be encountered when updating. These are mostly caused by the more stringent parser validation and the capture of errors that were previously ignored.
+
+
+* Made ``any_errors_fatal`` inheritable from play to task and all other objects in between.

+---------------------------------------------
+
+**OLD** In Ansible 2.2:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+    - name: example of using top-level options for connection properties
+      ios_command:
+        commands: show version
+        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
+        username: cisco
+        password: cisco
+        authorize: yes
+        auth_pass: cisco
+
+Will result in:
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+   [WARNING]: argument username has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version
+   [WARNING]: argument host has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version
+   [WARNING]: argument password has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version
+
+
+**NEW** In Ansible 2.3:
+
+
+.. code-block:: yaml
+
+   - name: Gather facts
+     eos_facts:
+       gather_subset: all
+       provider:
+         username: myuser
+         password: "{{ networkpassword }}"
+         transport: cli
+         host: "{{ ansible_host }}"
+
+delegate_to vs ProxyCommand
+---------------------------
+
+The new connection framework for Network Modules in Ansible 2.3 no longer supports the use of the
+``delegate_to`` directive.  In order to use a bastion or intermediate jump host
+to connect to network devices, network modules now support the use of
+``ProxyCommand``.
+
+To use ``ProxyCommand`` configure the proxy settings in the Ansible inventory
+file to specify the proxy host.
+
+.. code-block:: ini
+
+    [nxos]
+    nxos01
+    nxos02
+
+    [nxos:vars]
+    ansible_ssh_common_args='-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q bastion01"'
+
+
+With the configuration above, simply build and run the playbook as normal with
+no additional changes necessary.  The network module will now connect to the
+network device by first connecting to the host specified in
+``ansible_ssh_common_args`` which is ``bastion01`` in the above example.
+
+
+.. notes: Using ``ProxyCommand`` with passwords via variables
+
+   It is a feature that SSH doesn't support providing passwords via environment variables.
+   This is done to prevent secrets from leaking out, for example in ``ps`` output.
+
+   We recommend using SSH Keys, and if needed and ssh-agent, rather than passwords, where ever possible.
