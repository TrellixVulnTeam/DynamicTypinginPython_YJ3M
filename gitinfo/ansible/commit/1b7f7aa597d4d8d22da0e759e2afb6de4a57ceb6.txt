+Module Repo Information
+=======================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 
+
+This appears to be a submission about a module, and aside from action_plugins, if you know what those are, the modules
+in ansible are now moved two seperate repos.  We would appreciate if you can submit this there instead.
+
+If this is about a new module, submit pull requests or ideas to:
+
+   * https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+
+If this is about an existing module:
+
+   * Find the module at http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_all_modules.html
+   * Open the documentation page for that module
+   * If the bottom of the docs say "This is an extras module", submit your ticket to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
+   * Otherwise, submit your module to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core
+
+Additionally, should you need more help with this, you can ask questions on:
+
+   * IRC: #ansible on irc.freenode.net   
+   * mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project
+
+Thanks!
+
