    Mark azure_rm_hdinsightcluster test unstable.
    
    The unstable alias wasn't intended for slow but otherwise stable
    tests. However, the alternatives are to either dedicate an entire
    test group to this one test or mark it unsupported.
    
    Marking it unstable at least permits the test to run when changes
    are made to the integration test or the module itself, which is
    better than not running the tests at all.
