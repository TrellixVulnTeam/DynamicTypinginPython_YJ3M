+relative paths get attempted first with a 'files|templates|vars' in path (if not already present) depending on action being taken, 'files' is the default. (i.e include_vars will use vars/).
+paths will be searched from most specific to most general (i.e role before play).
+dependent roles WILL be traversed (i.e task is in role2, role2 is a dependency of role1, role2 will be looked at first, then role1, then play).
+role search path is rolename/{files|vars|templates}/, rolename/tasks/.
+play search path is playdir/{files|vars|templates}/, playdir/.
+the current working directory (cwd) is not searched. If you see it, it just happens to coincide with one of the paths above.
+include of a task file from a role will NOT trigger role behavior, this only happens when running as a role.
+new ansible_search_path var will have the search path used, in order.
+5 vs (-vvvvv) should show the detail of the search as it happens.
+this does NOT affect absolute paths
+includes try the path of the included file first and fall back to the play/role that includes them.
