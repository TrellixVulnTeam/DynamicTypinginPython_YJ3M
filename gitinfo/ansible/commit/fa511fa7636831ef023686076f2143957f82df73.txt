 Maintainers of Ansible modules are expected to provide feedback, responses, or actions on pull requests or issues to the module(s) they maintain in a reasonably timely manner.
 
+It is also recommended that you occasionally revisit the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alikins/ansible-modules-extras/commit/c87795da5b0c95c67fea1608a5a2a4ec54cb3905), as they are continually refined. Occasionally, you may be requested to update your module to move it closer to the general accepted standard requirements; we hope for this to be infrequent, and will always be a request with a fair amount of lead time (ie: not by tomorrow!). 
+
+Finally, following the ansible-devel mailing list can be a great way to participate in the broader Ansible community, and a place where you can influence the overall direction, quality, and goals of the Extras modules repository. If you're not on this relatively low-volume list, please join us here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel
+
 The Ansible community hopes that you will find that maintaining your module is as rewarding for you as having the module is for the wider community.

 At this time, we do not have an automated process by which Issues are handled. If you are a maintainer of a specific module, it is recommended that you periodically search module issues for issues which mention your module's name (or some variation on that name), as well as setting an appropriate notification process for receiving notification of mentions of your GitHub ID.
 
+## PR Workflow 
+
+Automated routing of pull requests is handled by a tool called [Ansibullbot](https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot). (You could say that he moooo-ves things around.)
+
+Being moderately familiar with how the workflow behind the bot operates can be helpful to you, and -- should things go awry -- your feedback can be helpful to the folks that continually help Ansibullbot to evolve.
