-   - This module will return C(public_ip) on success, which will contain the
-     public IP address associated with the device.
    - There may be a delay between the time the EIP is assigned and when
      the cloud instance is reachable via the new address. Use wait_for and
      pause to delay further playbook execution until the instance is reachable,
