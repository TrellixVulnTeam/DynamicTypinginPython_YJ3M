    Fix accelerate module on centos 5 by removing
    unsupported string prefix in 2.4
    
    http://docs.python.org/release/2.4/ref/strings.html
    This is also ignored on later version of python 2
    and is present only for python 3 conversion, as seen
    on http://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals
    
    Also see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6269765/what-does-the-b-character-do-in-front-of-a-string-literal
