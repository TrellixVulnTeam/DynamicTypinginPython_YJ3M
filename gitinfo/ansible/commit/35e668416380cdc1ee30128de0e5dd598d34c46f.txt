    Mark this as a string so it is rendered in the docs
    
    When this was treated as a boolean, sphinx was leaving the Default
    column on http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ec2_module.html blank,
    implying it would use AWS's default.  In reality, it passes False, which
    overrides the defaults at AWS (it's possible to boot an instance which
    AWS claims will always have EBS optimization without it because of this
    silently passed False).
