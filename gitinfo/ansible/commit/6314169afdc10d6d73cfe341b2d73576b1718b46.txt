    Update the comments around Python 3
    
    [Enterprise Linux 5 is at the end of "End of Production 3 phase"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux#Product_life_cycle) so that is no longer a reasonable reason to wait.  Also removed the comments about [Python 3 not being mainstream](http://python3wos.mybluemix.net/201).  Perhaps a link to https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/python_3_support.html would also be a useful addition to this question.

 Do not replace the shebang lines of your python modules.  Ansible will do this for you automatically at deploy time.
