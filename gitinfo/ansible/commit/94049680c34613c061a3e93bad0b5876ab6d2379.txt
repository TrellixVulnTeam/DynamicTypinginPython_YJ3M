    Add OpenBSD password encryption (#40647)
    
    OpenBSD comes with its own encryption utility as well, which must be run on the password text `encrypt <password>`. following the code block above, i just included the base command in the code block. I wasn't quite sure where to add my change, so I put it at the bottom of the section since the rest all flows well together.
