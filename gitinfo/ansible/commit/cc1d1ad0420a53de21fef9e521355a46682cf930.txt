-  - "Also, you can override jinja2 settings by adding a special header to template file.
-  i.e. C(#jinja2:variable_start_string:'[%' , variable_end_string:'%]')
-  which changes the variable interpolation markers to  [% var %] instead of  {{ var }}. This is the best way to prevent evaluation of things that look like, but should not be Jinja2.  raw/endraw in Jinja2 will not work as you expect because templates in Ansible are recursively evaluated."
