 When submitting patches, be sure to run the unit tests first “make tests” and always use 
 “git rebase” vs “git merge” (aliasing git pull to git pull --rebase is a great idea) to

+We’ll then review your contributions and engage with you about questions and  so on.  Please be advised we have a very large and active community,
 so it may take awhile to get your contributions in!  Patches should be made against the 'devel' branch.
 
 Contributions can be for new features like modules, or to fix bugs you or others have found. If you are interested in writing new modules to be included in the core Ansible distribution, please refer to the Module Developers documentation on our website at http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/moduledev.html.
