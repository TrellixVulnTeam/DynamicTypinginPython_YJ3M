    Add dnf and yum commands in "Installation" section (#33369)
    
    * Add dnf and yum commands in "Installation" section
    
    Even though the command is very simple, it's good to be able to c&p it.
    There were already commands for apt, emerge, pip, even direct installation
    from git, so adding Fedora/RHEL/CentOS examples is reasonable.
    
    Since yum is not installed by default on any supported Fedora releases
    (F26 and F28 currently), recommend dnf.
    
    * Tiny edit
