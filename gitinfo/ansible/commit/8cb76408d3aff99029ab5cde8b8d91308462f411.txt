    Update include_role description (#56001)
    
    * Update include_role description to discuss tasks: use
    
    The previous description in this statement's description really threw me off, and is IMO ambiguous at best. 'Loads and executes a role as a task dynamically. This frees roles from the roles: directive and allows them to be treated more as tasks.'
    
    For reference, I spent a long time trying to make include_role, with a loop, work under a roles: section. It doesn't work, but this documentation and its use of the roles: keyword in the opening, and the phrase '"more" as a task' muddies the waters.

 short_description: Load and execute a role
 description:
-  - Loads and executes a role as a task dynamically.
-  - This frees roles from the C(roles:) directive and allows them to be treated more as tasks.
-  - Unlike M(import_role), most keywords, including loop, with_items, and conditionals, apply to this statement.
-  - The do until loop is not supported on M(include_role).
+  - Dynamically loads and executes a specified role as a task.
+  - May be used only where Ansible tasks are allowed - inside C(pre_tasks), C(tasks), or C(post_tasks) playbook objects, or as a task inside a role.
+  - Task-level keywords, loops, and conditionals apply only to the C(include_role) statement itself.
+  - To apply keywords to the tasks within the role, pass them using the C(apply) option or use M(import_role) instead.
+  - Ignores some keywords, like C(until) and C(retries).
   - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
