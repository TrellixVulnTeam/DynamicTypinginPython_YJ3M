+Relative paths for configuration
+--------------------------------
+
+You can specify a relative path for many configuration options. In most of
+those cases the path used will be relative to the ``ansible.cfg`` file used
+for the current execution. If you need a path relative to your current working
+directory (CWD) you can use the ``{%raw%}{{CWD}}{%endraw%}`` macro to specify
+it. We do not recommend this approach, as using your CWD as the root of
+relative paths can be a security risk. For example:
+``cd /tmp; secureinfo=./newrootpassword ansible-playbook ~/safestuff/change_root_pwd.yml``.
