    Remove 'net' hardcoding on ansible-test executor (#28334)
    
    We need to run network-integration against platform agnostic modules,
    which they all are named as net_* .
    There is a hardcoding in executor where if prefix is 'net' the hosts is set
    to all, removing these lines to have desired behaviour.
