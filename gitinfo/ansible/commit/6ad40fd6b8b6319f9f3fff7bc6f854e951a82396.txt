 Controlling how Ansible behaves: precedence rules

+To give you maximum flexibility in managing your environments, Ansible offers many ways to control how Ansible behaves: how it connects to managed nodes, how it works once it has connected.
 If you use Ansible to manage a large number of servers, network devices, and cloud resources, you may define Ansible behavior in several different places and pass that information to Ansible in several different ways.
 This flexibility is convenient, but it can backfire if you do not understand the precedence rules.
