    Revert "Make the 'path' param type also use abspath on the value"
    
    This reverts commit 1ffadbcc80ccda1fefef18333e8e9aac44cfd6fa.
    
    Some modules seem to have path listed for things that are "commands"  --
    something that may be a path to a command or a bare command that should
    be looked up in PATH.  With this change, if they were formerly looked up
    inPATH they are now being made into an absolute path in the cwd.
    Reverting this until we can think more about whether to do this and
    change those modules to not use path for those parameters.
