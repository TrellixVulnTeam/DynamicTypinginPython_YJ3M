+Getting Started with VMware
+===========================
+
+Introduction
+````````````
+
+Ansible provides various modules to manage VMware infrastructure, which includes datacenter, cluster,
+host system and virtual machine.
+
+Requirements
+````````````
+
+Ansible VMware modules are written on top of `pyVmomi <https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi>`_.
+pyVmomi is the Python SDK for the VMware vSphere API that allows user to manage ESX, ESXi,
+and vCenter infrastcture. You can install pyVmomi using pip:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ pip install pyvmomi
+
+
+vmware_guest module
+```````````````````
+
+The :ref:vmware_guest <vmware_guest>module is used to manage various operations related to virtual machines in
+the given ESXi or vCenter server.
+
+Prior to Ansible version 2.5, ``folder`` was an optional parameter with a default value of ``/vm``. The folder parameter
+ was used to discover information about virtual machines in the given infrastructure.
+
+Starting with Ansible version 2.5, ``folder`` is still an optional parameter with no default value.
+This parameter will be now used to identify a user's virtual machine, if multiple virtual machines or virtual
+machine templates are found with same name. VMware does not restrict the system administrator from creating virtual
+machines with same name.
+
+Debugging
+`````````
+When debugging or creating a new issue, you will need information about your VMware infrastructure. You can get this information using
+`govc <https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc>`_, For example:
+
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ export GOVC_USERNAME=ESXI_OR_VCENTER_USERNAME
+    $ export GOVC_PASSWORD=ESXI_OR_VCENTER_PASSWORD
+    $ export GOVC_URL=https://ESXI_OR_VCENTER_HOSTNAME:443
+    $ govc find /
+
+
+.. seealso::
+
+    `pyVmomi <https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi>`_
+        The GitHub Page of pyVmomi
+    `pyVmomi Issue Tracker <https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/issues>`_
+        The issue tracker for the pyVmomi project
+    `govc <https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc>`_
+        govc is a vSphere CLI built on top of govmomi
