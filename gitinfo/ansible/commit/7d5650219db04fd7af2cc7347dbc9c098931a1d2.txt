    Fix openstack inventory for multiple servers
    
    Fix openstack inventory for when we have multiple servers with the same
    name but different IDs. Instead of giving every server with the same
    name the details for the first server returned with that name add the
    individual servers as they are returned.
    
    This was a logic bug where in a loop over a list of servers we always
    added the first server in that list despite having more than one server.
