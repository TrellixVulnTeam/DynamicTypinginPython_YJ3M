 You have already learned about inventory host and group variables, 'vars', and 'vars_files'.
 
 If a variable name is defined in more than one place with the same name, priority is as follows
-to determine which place sets the value of the variable.

-1.  Variables loaded from YAML files mentioned in 'vars_files' in a playbook.
