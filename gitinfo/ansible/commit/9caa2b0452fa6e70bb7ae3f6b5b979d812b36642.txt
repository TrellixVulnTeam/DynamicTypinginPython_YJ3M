 ==========
 
 Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to
-execute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer.
-This can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
-As of Ansible 2.1.0 this option is enabled by default.
-
-In previous versions, this option was disabled because of a bad interaction
-with some sudo configurations.  If sudo was configured to 'requiretty' for
-operation then pipelining would not work and ansible would fail to connect
-properly.  This could be remedied by removing 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on
-all managed hosts.
-
-It is recommended to leave this option enabled.  If you are stuck with an old
-version of ansible your first choice option should be to remove requiretty
-from the sudoers configuration and only disable pipelining if you cannot do
-that.  Enabling this eliminates the need for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`::
