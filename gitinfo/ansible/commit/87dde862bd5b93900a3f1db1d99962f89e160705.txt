++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Setting environment variables can be done with the `environment` keyword. It can be used at task or playbook level::
+
+    environment:
+      PATH: {{ ansible_env.PATH }}:/thingy/bin
+      SOME: value
 
-```
-  environment:
-     PATH:$PATH:/thingy/bin 
-```
 
 
 How do I handle different machines needing different user accounts or ports to log in with?
