    ios_command: Correct answer example and consolidate docs on command param. (#40158)
    
    * Correct answer example as 'c' cancels, not confirms. Moved command note to be in line with command docs.
    
    * Correct example to escape square brackets. Remove '\r' mention as it does not get passed correctly.
    
    * Add carriage return example since it works with double quotes.
    
    * Remove colon which was breaking docs rendering.
