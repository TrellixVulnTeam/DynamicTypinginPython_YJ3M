commit b432faa39563278ea00806c264b37e66457baf2c

    Put the advice to the user as comments in the template
    
    Most issues include parts of the advice from the template, which adds noise to tickets.
    E.g. A lot of tickets include the text "Please pick one and delete the rest:"
    
    By adding the advice to the user as comments (<!--- comment -->) we achieve two important things:
    
     1. The advice does not end up in the actual issue ticket or pull request
    
     2. It is easier for the user to differentiate its own input and the original advice
        (And my help them to clean up the advice as well, which in fact is now no longer necessary)
