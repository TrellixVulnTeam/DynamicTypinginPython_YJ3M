    Update win_firewall_rule.py (#2337)
    
    added profile examples as my firewall task would pass yet no firewall rule was created until I added
    
    profile: Domain,Private,Public
    
    When setting a Firewall rule on Windows Server 2008 R2 manually, these three are selected as default, useful to have in the documentation maybe?
