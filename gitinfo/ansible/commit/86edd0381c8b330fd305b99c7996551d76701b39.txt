+## 1.7.2 "Summer Nights" - Sep 24, 2014
+
+- Fixes a bug in accelerate mode which caused a traceback when trying to use that connection method.
+- Fixes a bug in vault where the password file option was not being used correctly internally.
+- Improved multi-line parsing when using YAML literal blocks (using > or |).
+- Fixed a bug with the file module and the creation of relative symlinks.

+## 1.7.1 "Summer Nights" - Aug 14, 2014
+
+- Security fix to disallow specifying 'args:' as a string, which could allow the insertion of extra module parameters through variables.
+- Performance enhancements related to previous security fixes, which could cause slowness when modules returned very large JSON results. This specifically impacted the unarchive module frequently, which returns the details of all unarchived files in the result.
+- Docker module bug fixes:
+  * Fixed support for specifying rw/ro bind modes for volumes
+  * Fixed support for allowing the tag in the image parameter
+- Various other bug fixes

 Ansible manages machines in an agentless manner. There is never a question of how to
 upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled.  As OpenSSH is one of the most peer reviewed open source components, the security exposure of using the tool is greatly reduced.  Ansible is decentralized -- it relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines; if needed it can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized authentication management systems.
 
-This documentation covers the current released version of Ansible (1.7.1) and also some development version features (1.8).  For recent features, in each section, the version of Ansible where the feature is added is indicated.  Ansible, Inc releases a new major release of Ansible approximately every 2 months.  The core application evolves somewhat conservatively, valuing simplicity in language design and setup, while the community around new modules and plugins being developed and contributed moves very very quickly, typically adding 20 or so new modules in each release.
