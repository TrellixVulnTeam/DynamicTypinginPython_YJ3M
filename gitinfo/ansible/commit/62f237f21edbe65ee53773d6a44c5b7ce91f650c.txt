    fix erroneous example in inventory (#36625)
    
    After initializing a list in both Python2/Python3 with below elements,
    I've tested the indexing and realised that the examples provided in the
    documentation are erroneous.
    
    As a result, update the examples with correct values in order to avoid
    any future confusion.
