 .. note: If you find yourself having too many top level playbooks (for instance you have a playbook you wrote for a specific hotfix, etc), it may make sense to have a playbooks/ directory instead.  This can be a good idea as you get larger.  If you do this, configure your roles_path in ansible.cfg to find your roles location.

+Alternatively you can put each inventory file with its ``group_vars``/``host_vars`` in a separate directory. This is particularly useful if your ``group_vars``/``host_vars`` don't have that much in common in different environments. The layout could look something like this::

+    inventories/
+       production/
+          hosts.ini           # inventory file for production servers
+          group_vars/
+             group1           # here we assign variables to particular groups
+             group2           # ""
+          host_vars/
+             hostname1        # if systems need specific variables, put them here

+
+This layout gives you more flexibility for larger environments, as well as a total separation of inventory variables between different environments. The downside is that it is harder to maintain, because there are more files.
