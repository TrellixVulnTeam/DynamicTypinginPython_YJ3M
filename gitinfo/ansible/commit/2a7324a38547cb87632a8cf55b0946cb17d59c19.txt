    Update redhat_subscriptions 'server_insecure' docs (#3373)
    
    'server_insecure' maps to the subscription-manager config
    (/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf) value for 'insecure' key in the
    'server' stanza. The 'insecure' configures if the https connection
    to 'server_hostname' is verified as having been issued by
    a CA in 'ca_cert_dir' trust store.
    
    Previous documentation indicating it disables https and
    enables http was inaccurate. Connection to server_hostname
    always uses https.
