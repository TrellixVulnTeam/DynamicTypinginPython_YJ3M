 To enable this feature, a command line tool, :ref:`ansible-vault` is used to edit files, and a command line flag :option:`--ask-vault-pass <ansible-vault-create --ask-vault-pass>`, :option:`--vault-password-file <ansible-vault-create --vault-password-file>` or :option:`--vault-id <ansible-playbook --vault-id>` is used. You can also modify your ``ansible.cfg`` file to specify the location of a password file or configure Ansible to always prompt for the password. These options require no command line flag usage.
