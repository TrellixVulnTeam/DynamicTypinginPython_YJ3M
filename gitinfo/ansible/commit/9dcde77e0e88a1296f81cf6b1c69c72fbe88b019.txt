    Document using the `raw` module to install a py2.X and simplejson
    
    In the installation guide, the raw module is mentioned as an option for
    installing Python or simplejson on managed nodes that don't have them.
    This change adds an example for users that may already be familiar with
    using ansible but are checking install docs because they don't know the
    requirements for managed nodes, or are using a distribution that doesn't
    include Python 2 by default.
