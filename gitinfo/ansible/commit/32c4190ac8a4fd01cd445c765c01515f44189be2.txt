    Remove reference to ansible-validate-modules (#3256)
    
    ansible-validate-modules is now in ansible/ansible
    
    During 2.3 we will be merge the modules into ansible/ansible so this file will go away.
    
    The new testing documentation will refer to `ansible-test` which will wrap up the unit, integration, and ansible-validate-modules. So no need to document here.
