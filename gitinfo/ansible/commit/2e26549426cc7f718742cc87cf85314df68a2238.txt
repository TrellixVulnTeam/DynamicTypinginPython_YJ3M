    Update apt:deb with correct version
    
    The docs site says this option is available in 1.5, but it is not.
    
    #5910 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/5910 added the deb option.  The PR was generated two months ago (before 1.5) but was not included until after 1.5 was released.  This fixes the docs.
