+- '**Security Fix** - Some connection exceptions would cause no_log specified on
+  a task to be ignored.  If this happened, the task information, including any
+  private information could have been displayed to stdout and (if enabled, not
+  the default) logged to a log file specified in ansible.cfg''s log_path.
+  Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from ansible runs to a log file
+  may have stored that private information onto disk that way as well.
