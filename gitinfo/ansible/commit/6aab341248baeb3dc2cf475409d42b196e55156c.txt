     jumper ansible_port=5555 ansible_host=192.0.2.50
 
 In the above example, trying to ansible against the host alias "jumper" (which may not even be a real hostname) will contact 192.0.2.50 on port 5555.  Note that this is using a feature of the inventory file to define some special variables.  Generally speaking this is not the best
 way to define variables that describe your system policy, but we'll share suggestions on doing this later.  We're just getting started.
