    Change message when a play matches no hosts
    
    I guess my previous pull request was confusing, by changing the message to something we already do for tasks, it makes it more clear.
    
    Just like we say:
    
        TASK: [foo bar]
        skipping: [system01]
    
    The message now is more clear:
    
        PLAY [wagawaga] *******************************
        skipping: no hosts matched
    
    It makes it clear that we are skipping the play, just as is done for a task when a condition is not met.
