 1. Does a similar module already exist?
 
-There are a lot of existing modules available, and more that are in development. You should check out the list of existing modules at :doc:`../modules` or look at the `module PRs <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/labels/module>`_ for the ansible repository on Github to see if a module that does what you want exists or is in development.

-2. Should you use or develop an action plugin instead?
+2. Has someone already worked on a similar Pull Request?
+
+It's possible that someone has already started developing a similar PR. There are a few ways to find open module Pull Requests:
+
+* `GitHub new module PRs <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/labels/new_module>`_
+* `All updates to modules <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/labels/module>`_
+* `New module PRs listed by directory <https://ansible.sivel.net/pr/byfile.html>`_ search for `lib/ansible/modules/`
+
+If you find an existing PR that looks like it addresses the issue you are trying to solve, please provide feedback on the PR -  this will speed up getting the PR merged.
+
+3. Should you use or develop an action plugin instead?
 
 Action plugins get run on the master instead of on the target. For modules like file/copy/template, some of the work needs to be done on the master before the module executes on the target. Action plugins execute first on the master and can then execute the normal module on the target if necessary.
 
 For more information about action plugins, `read the action plugins documentation here <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html>`_.
