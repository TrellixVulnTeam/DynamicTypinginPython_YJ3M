    * nose must be installed - https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
-   * ansible tests require paramiko, PyYAML and json modules
-   * The (optional) facter test requires facter to be installed.
-   * Your user environment should allow "ssh myip" (where myip is your ip address)
-     without a password - so a key held in ssh-agent and an authorised_keys entry.
+   * ansible tests require paramiko, PyYAML python modules, and python 2.6+.
+   * Some tests require additional components (facter, ohai) and will be skipped if not available.
+   * Your user environment should allow "ssh 127.0.0.1"
+     without a password - so a key held in ssh-agent and an authorized_keys entry.
