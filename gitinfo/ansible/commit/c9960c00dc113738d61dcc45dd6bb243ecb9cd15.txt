 module: include_vars
 short_description: Load variables from files, dynamically within a task.
 description:
-     - Loads variables from a YAML/JSON file dynamically during task runtime.  It can work with conditionals, or use host specific variables to determine the path name to load from.
+     - Loads variables from a YAML/JSON files dynamically from within a file or
+       from a directory recursively during task runtime. If loading a directory, the files are sorted alphabetically before being loaded.
 options:
   file:
     version_added: "2.2"
     description:
        - The file name from which variables should be loaded.
        - If the path is relative, it will look for the file in vars/ subdirectory of a role or relative to playbook.
+  dir:
+    version_added: "2.2"
+    description:
+      - The directory name from which the variables should be loaded.
+      - If the path is relative, it will look for the file in vars/ subdirectory of a role or relative to playbook.
+    default: null
   name:
     version_added: "2.2"
     description:
         - The name of a variable into which assign the included vars, if omitted (null) they will be made top level vars.
     default: null
+  depth:
+    version_added: "2.2"
+    description:
+      - By default, this module will recursively go through each sub directory and load up the variables. By explicitly setting the depth, this module will only go as deep as the depth.
+    default: 0
+  files_matching:
+    version_added: "2.2"
+    description:
+      - Limit the variables that are loaded within any directory to this regular expression.
+    default: null
+  ignore_files:
+    version_added: "2.2"
+    description:
+      - List of file names to ignore. The defaults can not be overridden, but can be extended.
+    default: null
   free-form:
     description:
         - This module allows you to specify the 'file' option directly w/o any other options.
-notes:
-    - The file is always required either as the explicit option or using the free-form.
