-short_description: An Ansible module to handle states enable/disable server and set weight to backend host in haproxy using socket commands.
+short_description: Enable, disable, and set weights for HAProxy backend servers using socket commands.
 description:
-    - The Enable Haproxy Backend Server, with
-      supports get current weight for server (default) and
-      set weight for haproxy backend server when provides.
-
-    - The Disable Haproxy Backend Server, with
-      supports get current weight for server (default) and
-      shutdown sessions while disabling backend host server.
+    - Enable, disable, and set weights for HAProxy backend servers using socket
+      commands.
 notes:
-    - "enable or disable commands are restricted and can only be issued on sockets configured for level 'admin', "
-    - "Check - http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/configuration.txt, "
