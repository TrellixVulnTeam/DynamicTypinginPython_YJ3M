 Some tests may require cloud credentials.
 
+Tests should be run as root.
+
+Configuration
+=============
+
+Making your own version of integration_config.yml can allow for setting some tunable parameters to help run
+the tests better in your environment.
+
+Non-destructive Tests
+=====================
+
+These tests will modify files in subdirectories, but will not do things that install or remove packages or things
+outside of those test subdirectories.  They will also not reconfigure or bounce system services.
+
+Run as follows:
+
+    # sh test.sh # OR
+    # ansible-playbook non_destructive.yml -i inventory -e @integration_config.yml -v $*
+
+You can select specific tests with the --tags parameter.
+
+Destructive Tests
+=================
+
+These tests are allowed to install and remove some trivial packages.  You will likely want to devote these
+to a virtual environment.  They won't reformat your filesystem, however :)
+    
+    # ansible-playbook destructive.yml -i inventory -e @integration_config.yml -v $*
+
+Cloud Tests
+===========
+
+Details pending, but these require cloud credentials.  These are not 'tests run in the cloud' so much as tests
+that leverage the cloud modules and are organized by cloud provider.
