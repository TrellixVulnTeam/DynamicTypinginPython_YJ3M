 By default variables are merged/flattened to the specific host before a play is run. This keeps Ansible focused on the Host and Task, so groups don't really surive outside of inventory and host matching. By default, Ansible overwrites variables including the ones defined for a group and/or host (see the `hash_merge` setting to change this) . The order/precedence is (from lowest to highest):
 
-- all group (becauseit is the 'parent' of all other groups)
+- all group (because it is the 'parent' of all other groups)
 - parent group
 - child group
 - host
