    Remove version-added on name field.
    
    This parameter was actually added in 2.0.  It's just that the
    documentation in previous versions of the module were wrong (it said the
    name was  "network" rather than "name.)  I've renamed the parameter in
    the documentation of prior versions so ansible-module-validate should no
    longer think that this is a new parameter.
