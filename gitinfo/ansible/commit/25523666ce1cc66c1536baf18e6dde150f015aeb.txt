commit 25523666ce1cc66c1536baf18e6dde150f015aeb

    Modules that have a link to their own deprecated section need to use a different link syntax (#38697)
    
    The :ref: syntax is for linking to targets which are defined for the
    whole document tree.  `link`_ is for linking to targets which are inside
    of the document.  We want the latter for deprecated sections because
    otherwise we'd have to create namespaced link targets for them.
    
    Also fix expansion of version a deprecated module will be removed in
