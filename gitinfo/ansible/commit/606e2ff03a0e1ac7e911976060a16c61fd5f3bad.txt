    Disable Automerge (#61674)
    
    A few PRs have been automerged since devel became 2.10 even though they still had `version_added: 2.9`
    
    Lets disable automerge till:
    a) We find a proper fix (automerge should so `rebuild_merge`?)
    b) We wait 7 days since devel became 1.10 to cause stale_ci
