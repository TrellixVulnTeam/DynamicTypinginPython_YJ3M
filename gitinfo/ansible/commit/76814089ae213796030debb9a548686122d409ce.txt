    Using a higher value for ``--forks`` will result in kicking off asynchronous
    tasks even faster.  This also increases the efficiency of polling.
 
+If you would like to perform a variation of the "fire and forget" where you 
+"fire and forget, check on it later" you can perform a task similar to the 
+following::
+
+      --- 
+      # Requires ansible 1.7+
+      - name: 'YUM - fire and forget task'
+        yum: name=docker-io state=installed
+        async: 1000
+        poll: 0
+        register: yum_sleeper
+
+      - name: 'YUM - check on fire and forget task'
+        async_status: jid={{ yum_sleeper.ansible_job_id }}
+        register: job_result
+        until: job_result.finished
+        retries: 30
+
+.. note::
+   If the value of ``async:`` is not high enough, this will cause the 
+   "check on it later" task to fail because the temporary status file that
+   the ``async_status:`` is looking for will not have been written
