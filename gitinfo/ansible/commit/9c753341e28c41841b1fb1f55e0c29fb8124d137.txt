    Porting guide: transfer entries to collection changelogs (#70064)
    
    * Remove community.crypto parts from porting guide.
    * Remove community.general parts from porting guide.
    * Removed 'modules removed' section, since this is better suited for a general entry on the collection split.

 * :ref:`iam_policy <iam_policy_module>`: the ``policy_document`` option will be removed. To maintain the existing behavior use the ``policy_json`` option and read the file with the ``lookup`` plugin.

 The following functionality will change in Ansible 2.14. Please update update your playbooks accordingly.
 
-* The :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>` module has a new option, ``container_default_behavior``, whose default value will change from ``compatibility`` to ``no_defaults``. Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings.
-* The :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>` module's ``network_mode`` option will be set by default to the name of the first network in ``networks`` if at least one network is given and ``networks_cli_compatible`` is ``true`` (will be default from Ansible 2.12 on). Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings if you specify networks and set ``networks_cli_compatible`` to ``true``. The current default (not specifying it) is equivalent to the value ``default``.
 * :ref:`ec2 <ec2_module>`: the ``group`` and ``group_id`` options will become mutually exclusive.  Currently ``group_id`` is ignored if you pass both.
 * :ref:`iam_policy <iam_policy_module>`: the default value for the ``skip_duplicates`` option will change from ``true`` to ``false``.  To maintain the existing behavior explicitly set it to ``true``.
 * :ref:`iam_role <iam_role_module>`: the ``purge_policies`` option (also know as ``purge_policy``) default value will change from ``true`` to ``false``

 * :ref:`vmware_tag <vmware_tag_module>` now returns ``tag_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
 * The deprecated ``recurse`` option in :ref:`pacman <pacman_module>` module has been removed, you should use ``extra_args=--recursive`` instead.
 * :ref:`vmware_guest_custom_attributes <vmware_guest_custom_attributes_module>` module does not require VM name which was a required parameter for releases prior to Ansible 2.10.
-* :ref:`zabbix_action <zabbix_action_module>` no longer requires ``esc_period`` and ``event_source`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
-* :ref:`zabbix_proxy <zabbix_proxy_module>` deprecates ``interface`` sub-options ``type`` and ``main`` when proxy type is set to passive via ``status=passive``. Make sure these suboptions are removed from your playbook as they were never supported by Zabbix in the first place.
-* :ref:`gitlab_user <gitlab_user_module>` no longer requires ``name``, ``email`` and ``password`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
 * :ref:`win_pester <win_pester_module>` no longer runs all ``*.ps1`` file in the directory specified due to it executing potentially unknown scripts. It will follow the default behaviour of only running tests for files that are like ``*.tests.ps1`` which is built into Pester itself
 * :ref:`win_find <win_find_module>` has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:
     * When the directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will just warn the user
     * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches the :ref:`win_stat <win_stat_module>`
     * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory
-* :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>` no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart.
-* :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>`'s support for port ranges was adjusted to be more compatible to the ``docker`` command line utility: a one-port container range combined with a multiple-port host range will no longer result in only the first host port be used, but the whole range being passed to Docker so that a free port in that range will be used.
 * :ref:`purefb_fs <purefb_fs_module>` no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs`` option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.
 * :ref:`nxos_igmp_interface <nxos_igmp_interface_module>` no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix`` and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
 * :ref:`aws_s3 <aws_s3_module>` can now delete versioned buckets even when they are not empty - set mode to delete to delete a versioned bucket and everything in it.
 * The parameter ``message`` in :ref:`grafana_dashboard <grafana_dashboard_module>` module is renamed to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
-* The parameter ``message`` in :ref:`datadog_monitor <datadog_monitor_module>` module is renamed to ``notification_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
-* The parameter ``message`` in :ref:`bigpanda <bigpanda_module>` module is renamed to ``deployment_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
 * Ansible no longer looks for Python modules in the current working directory (typically the ``remote_user``'s home directory) when an Ansible module is run. This is to fix becoming an unprivileged user on OpenBSD and to mitigate any attack vector if the current working directory is writable by a malicious user. Install any Python modules needed to run the Ansible modules on the managed node in a system-wide location or in another directory which is in the ``remote_user``'s ``$PYTHONPATH`` and readable by the ``become_user``.
 
 
@@ -153,7 +130,6 @@ Noteworthy plugin changes
 -------------------------
 
 * Cache plugins in collections can be used to cache data from inventory plugins. Previously, cache plugins in collections could only be used for fact caching.
-* The ``hashi_vault`` lookup plugin now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.
 * Some undocumented arguments from ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` have been removed; plugins using these, in particular action plugins, need to be adjusted. The undocumented arguments which were removed are ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``.
