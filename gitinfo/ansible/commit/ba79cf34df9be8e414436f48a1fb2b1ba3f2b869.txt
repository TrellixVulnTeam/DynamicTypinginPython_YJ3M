 How do I copy files recursively onto a target host?
 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
-The "copy" module doesn't handle recursive copies of directories. A common solution to do this is to use a local action to call 'rsync' to recursively copy files to the managed servers.
-
-Here is an example::
-
-    ---
-    # ...
-      tasks:
-      - name: recursively copy files from management server to target
-        local_action: command rsync -a /path/to/files $inventory_hostname:/path/to/target/
-
-Note that you'll need passphrase-less SSH or ssh-agent set up to let rsync copy without prompting for a passphrase or password.
+The "copy" module has a recursive parameter, though if you want to do something more efficient for a large number of files, take a look at the "synchronize" module instead, which wraps rsync.  See the module index for info on both of these modules.
