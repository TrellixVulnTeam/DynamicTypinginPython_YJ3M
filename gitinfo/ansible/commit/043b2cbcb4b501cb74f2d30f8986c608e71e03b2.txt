    Change example to use pkg rather than the obsolete pkg_add
    
    pkg_add has been obsoleted in all released versions of FreeBSD for
    several years.  Change the example to use the appropriate pkg(8)
    command line.

 For Ansible to effectively manage your machine, we need to install Python along with a json library, in this case we are using Python 2.7 which already has json included.
 On your control machine you can simply execute the following for most versions of FreeBSD::
 
-    ansible -m raw -a “pkg_add -r python27” mybsdhost1
+    ansible -m raw -a “pkg install -y python27” mybsdhost1
 
 Once this is done you can now use other Ansible modules aside from the ``raw`` module.
