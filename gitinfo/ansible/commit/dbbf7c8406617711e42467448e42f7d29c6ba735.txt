 * Added `meta: refresh_inventory` to force rereading the inventory in a play.
   This re-executes inventory scripts, but does not force them to ignore any cache they might use.
 * Now when you delegate an action that returns ansible_facts, these facts will be applied to the delegated host, unlike before when they were applied to the current host.
+* local connections now work with 'su' as a privilege escalation method
 * New ssh configuration variables(`ansible_ssh_common_args`, `ansible_ssh_extra_args`) can be used to configure a
   per-group or per-host ssh ProxyCommand or set any other ssh options.
   `ansible_ssh_extra_args` is used to set options that are accepted only by ssh (not sftp or scp, which have their own analogous settings).
