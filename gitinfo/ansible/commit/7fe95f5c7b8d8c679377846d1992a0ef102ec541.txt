+Ticket Stubs 
+============
+
+What's this?
+
+This is a directory of common responses to save some typing when responding to GitHub tickets to avoid
+some carpal tunnel syndrome events as Ansible takes off into stratosphere territory.
+
+These are actually on GitHub so it's easy for people to make these snippets of text even more helpful
+or to correct typos. 
+
+(It's just expected that folks like @mpdehaan and @jimi-c will be pasting these in though, we'd ask
+that others not do this)
+
+If there are questions, email michael@ansible.com!
