+Switch to Proposal
+===================
+
+Hi!
+
+As of April of 2016, we have started using the Ansible Proposal process for large feature ideas or changes in current functionality, such as this. If you are still interested in seeing this new feature get into Ansible, please submit a proposal for it using this process.
+
+https://github.com/ansible/proposals/blob/master/proposals_process_proposal.md
+
+If you have any further questions, please let us know by stopping by our devel mailing list, or our devel IRC channel:
+
+   * #ansible-devel on Freenode
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel
+
+Thank you!
