    Rename pycompat to pycompat24
    
    This change makes it so we know when it is safe to get rid of the module
    (when we stop supporting python2.4) and makes it easier for us to find
    code that is using the functions in there to update.
    
    If needed, we'll create a pycompat26 and pycompat27 as well.  These
    files are for functions that are needed on that python version to write
    portable code.  So python-2.4 compatible modules may need code in
    pycompat24, python26+ modules may need code in pycompat26, etc.  If
    a function is needed in multiple python versions, we should implement it
    in an internal common file and use import to put it in the namespace for
    each pycompatXY module.
