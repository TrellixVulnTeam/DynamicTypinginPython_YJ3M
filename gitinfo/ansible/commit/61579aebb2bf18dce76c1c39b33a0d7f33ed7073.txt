    cron: don't force changed=True when old crontab was empty
    
    The cron module forces changed=True when there was no real change,
    but the original crontab did not contain a final newline, which is
    mandatory.
    
    When the user has no crontab or the user does not exist at all,
    crontab -l exits with 1 and the cron module correctly interprets
    this as "no crontab" and stores the old crontab as "".
    
    However this triggers changed=True, even if we're not going to
    change anything, e.g. when removing a crontab entry from a user
    who has no crontabs at all.
    
    Let's special-case the fact that the old crontab is empty and not
    force changed=True in that case.
