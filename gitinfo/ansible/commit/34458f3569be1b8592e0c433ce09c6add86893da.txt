+Cache plugins store gathered facts and data retrieved by inventory plugins.
 
 Import cache plugins using the cache_loader so you can use ``self.set_options()`` and ``self.get_option(<option_name>)``. If you import a cache plugin directly in the code base, you can only access options via ``ansible.constants``, and you break the cache plugin's ability to be used by an inventory plugin.

 Noteworthy plugin changes
 -------------------------
 
+* Cache plugins in collections can be used to cache data from inventory plugins. Previously, cache plugins in collections could only be used for fact caching.
 * The ``hashi_vault`` lookup plugin now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.
 * Some undocumented arguments from ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` have been removed; plugins using these, in particular action plugins, need to be adjusted. The undocumented arguments which were removed are ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``.
