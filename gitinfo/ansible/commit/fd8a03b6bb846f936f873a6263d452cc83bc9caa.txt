+Testing
+=======
+
+  * Much of ansible's testing needs are in integration, not unit tests.  We're working on releasing wide array of integration tests that use modules in a live environment.
+  * That being said, there are unit tests
+  * Code written must absolutely pass unit tests (i.e. "make tests")
+  * You should anticipate any error paths in your code and test down those error paths.
+  * Additions to unit tests for core code is welcome, but modules tend to be more integration-testey, so it's not always possible to add them (examples: ec2, etc).

+File Conventions
+================
 
-Find
-====
+If a piece of code looks for a named YAML file in a directory, it should assume it can take no extension, or an extension of '.yml' or '.yaml'.
+This should be true against all code that loads files.
