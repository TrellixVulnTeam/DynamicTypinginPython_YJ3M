    Clarifies File module docs re: absent state (#28748)
    
    - The passage beginning "Note that file will not fail..." was slightly
      unclear about the fact that it referred to the behavior of the module
      when `state` is set to `absent`.
    - Fixes #23203

         If C(touch) (new in 1.4), an empty file will be created if the C(path) does not

         modification times (similar to the way `touch` works from the command line).
