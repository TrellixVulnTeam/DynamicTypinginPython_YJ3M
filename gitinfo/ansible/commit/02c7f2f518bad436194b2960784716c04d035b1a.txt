+Hi!
+
+Thank you very much for your submission to Ansible. It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken the time to contribute.
+
+Unfortunately, we're not sure if we want this feature in the program.
+
+However, we recommend looking into providing this functionality through Ansible Galaxy via Ansible Collections. You can find more information about collections at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/collections_tech_preview.html.
+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
+
+If you have further questions please stop by IRC or the mailing list:
