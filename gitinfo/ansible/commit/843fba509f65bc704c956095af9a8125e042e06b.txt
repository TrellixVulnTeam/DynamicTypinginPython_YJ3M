 In the first task, we ensure we have a running VM created with the Debian template. If the VM is already created but stopped, it would just start it. If you like to change the offering on an existing VM, you must add ``force: yes`` to the task, which would stop the VM, change the offering and start the VM again.

 In the last task we wait for SSH to be accessible, so any later play would be able to access the VM by SSH without failure.
