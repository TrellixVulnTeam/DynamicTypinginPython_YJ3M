-<<<<<<< HEAD
-  Ansible 2.0 has depricated the “ssh” from ``ansible_ssh_user``, ``ansible_ssh_host``, and ``ansible_ssh_port`` to become ``ansible_user``, ``ansible_host``, and ``ansible_port``. If you are using a version of Ansible prior to 2.0,  you should continue using the older style variables (``ansible_ssh_*``). These shorter variables are ignored, without warning, in older versions of Ansible.
