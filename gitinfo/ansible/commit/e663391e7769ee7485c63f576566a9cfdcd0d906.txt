    Fix yum test case on ppc64le
    
    This patch covers a few changes to get the yum test case working on ppc64le
    CentOS.  Specifically we needed to enable the EPEL repository on CentOS
    as well as ensure some of the architecture-specific tasks use the right
    set of binaries during their test.
