    Mention other ways to handle private key files (#57238)
    
    Often when I am helping others learn Ansible, they are using nodes spun up on Amazon/Google/etc.  where private key files (pem) are needed.  Mentioning just a bit more on how to handle those private key files on the intro_getting_started page will help more folks get started faster.
    I even reviewed the changes with my learning team and they all agreed this helped clarify immediately for them how to really get started with Ansible from a practical perspective.
