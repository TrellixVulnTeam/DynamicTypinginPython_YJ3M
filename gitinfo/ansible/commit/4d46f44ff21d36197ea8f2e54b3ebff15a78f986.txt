    nxos_snmp_traps:sanity: skip idempotency tests for I7 image bug (#55618)
    
    This is a sanity test cleanup to handle a known image bug with (N9K) I7 images.
    The I7 image fails to enable some snmp trap link configs causing an idempotency failure in the sanity, so we're skipping the idempotence tests that involve this bug.
    
    Tested on N9K images: 9.2(2), 7.0(3)I7.
