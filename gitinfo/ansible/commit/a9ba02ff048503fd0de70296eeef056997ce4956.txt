+environment variables (SL_USERNAME and SL_API_KEY). You can also write INI file to
+~/.softlayer or /etc/softlayer.conf. For more information see the SL API at:
+- https://softlayer-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config_file.html

+The SoftLayer Python client has a built in command for saving this configuration file
+via the command `sl config setup`.
