    Fix docs/api sphinx-build err on 'make rpm' (#24334)
    
    The makefile in docs/api/ had a top level check for the
    'sphinx-build' tool, but the check was getting triggered
    on 'make clean' when it is not needed and causing 'make rpm'
    and similar builds to fail.
    
    So this commit removes the check.
    
    Fixes #24163
