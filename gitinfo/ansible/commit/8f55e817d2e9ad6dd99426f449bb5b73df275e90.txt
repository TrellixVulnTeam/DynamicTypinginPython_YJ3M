    Correct Errors in Documentation (#50507)
    
    * Correct Errors in Documentation
    
    According to the module, "compose" is not required, but the docs said it was - removed the "required" tag. Additionally, the example for removing a stack did not include the required "name" option (this method is why "compose" is not required.
    +label: docsite_pr
    
    * Removed change to description
    
    Corrected issue to my "correction" on the description.
    
    * Removed required false
    
    * Removed all instances of required: false.
