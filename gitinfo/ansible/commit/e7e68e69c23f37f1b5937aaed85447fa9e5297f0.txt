-Patch Instructions
-==================
-
-Contributions to the core and modules are greatly welcome.
-
-   * Required Process:
-       * Submit github pull requests to the "ansible/devel" branch for features
-       * Fixes for bugs may also be submitted to "ansible/release-X.Y" for the last release
-       * Make sure "make tests" passes before submitting any requests.
-   * Bonus points:
-       * Joining the mailing list
-       * Fixing bugs instead of sending bug reports.
-       * Using squash merges
-       * Updating the "rst/*" files in the docs project and "docs/" manpage content
-       * Adding more unit tests
-   * Avoid:
-       * Sending patches to the mailing list directly.
-       * Sending feature pull requests to the 'release' branch instead of the devel branch
-       * Sending pull requests to mpdehaan's personal ansible fork.
-
+   * We'd love to have your contributions, read "CONTRIBUTING.md" for process notes.
