 - If you are using SSH keys (including an ssh-agent) you can remove the ``ansible_password`` configuration.
 - If you are accessing your host directly (not through a bastion/jump host) you can remove the ``ansible_ssh_common_args`` configuration.
 - If you are accessing your host through a bastion/jump host, you cannot include your SSH password in the ``ProxyCommand`` directive. To prevent secrets from leaking out (for example in ``ps`` output), SSH does not support providing passwords via environment variables.
+- If you are getting timeout errors you may want to add ``+cet1024w`` suffix to your username which will disable console colors, enable "dumb" mode, tell RouterOS not to try detecting terminal capabilities and set terminal width to 1024 columns. See article `Console login process <https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Console_login_process>`_ in MikroTik wiki for more information.
