 Misc changes:
 
+* Includes now support the more standard syntax, similar to that of role includes and dependencies. It is no longer necessary to specify a special "vas" field for the variables passed to the include.
 * Changed the `user:` parameter on plays to `remote_user:` to prevent confusion with the module of the same name.  Still backwards compatible on play parameters.
 * Added parameter to allow the fetch module to skip the md5 validation step ('validate_md5=false'). This is usefull when fetching files that are actively being written to, such as live log files.
