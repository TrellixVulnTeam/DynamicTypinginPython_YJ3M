+Deprecation Cycle
+`````````````````
+
+Sometimes we need to remove a feature, normally in favor of a reimplementation that we hope does a better job.
+To do this we have a deprecation cycle. First we mark a feature as 'deprecated'. This is normally accompanied with warnings
+to the user as to why we deprecated it, what alternatives they should switch to and when (which version) we are scheduled
+to remove the feature permanently.
+
+The cycle is normally across 4 feature releases (2.x.y, where the x marks a feature release and the y a bugfix release),
+so the feature is normally removed in the 4th release after we announce the deprecation.
+For example, something deprecated in 2.5 will be removed in 2.9, assuming we don't jump to 3.x before that point.
+The tracking is tied to the number of releases, not the release numbering.
+
+For modules/plugins, we keep the documentation after the removal for users of older versions.
