    cyberark appears to have renamed their collection
    
    Trying to build docs for Ansible-2.10 and ran into error #69475
    in ansible-doc.  To work around that I need to get a newer cyberark
    collection which fixes the issues.  Unfortunately, it looks like the
    cyberark team has renamed their collection from bizdev to pas is not
    responding to issues on github.  I'm putting in this PR for them to
    get this updated before 2.10 so that the modules will work out of the
    box.
