 Installing collections
-----------------------
+======================
 
 You can use the ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` command to install a collection on your system. The collection by default is installed at ``/path/ansible_collections/my_namespace/my_collection``. You can optionally add the ``-p`` option to specify an alternate location.
