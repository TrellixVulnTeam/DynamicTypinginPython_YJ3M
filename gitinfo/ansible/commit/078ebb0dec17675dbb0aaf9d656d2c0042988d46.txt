    Don't re-inject become* variables as it causes problems when templating is involved
    
    Prior to 75b6f61, we strictly limited variables we re-injected. After that
    patch however, we re-injected everything which causes problems under certain
    circumstances. For now, we'll continue to filter out some properties of
    PlayContext for re-injection.
    
    Fixes #14352
