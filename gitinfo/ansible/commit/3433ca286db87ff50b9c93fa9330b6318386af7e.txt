 If your module meets our objective requirements, we'll review your code to see if we think it's clear, concise, secure, and maintainable. We'll consider whether your module provides a good user experience, helpful error messages, reasonable defaults, and more. This process is subjective, and we can't list exact standards for acceptance. For the best chance of getting your module accepted into the Ansible repo, follow our :ref:`tips for module development <developing_modules_best_practices>`.
