+Homepage and documentation source for the Ansible
+=================================================
+
+This project hosts the source behind [ansible.github.com](http://ansible.github.com)
+
+Contributions to the documentation are welcome.  To make changes, submit a pull request
+that changes the restructured text files in the "rst/" directory only, and Michael can
+do a docs build and push the static files.
+
+If you do not want to learn RST format (ReStructured Text), you can also file issues
+on the documentation project. 
+
+If you are using ansible at your company or software project, additions to the "Who Uses
+Ansible" page are welcome.  Email Michael at the address below to be added.
