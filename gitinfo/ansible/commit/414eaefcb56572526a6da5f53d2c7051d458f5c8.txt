    Fix idempotency issue for network modules. (#32838)
    
    After the connection refactor if response value returned from
    the remote device is empty in that case an `ok` return value is send
    to module side code. To avoid this do not overwrite the empty response
    received from remote device in `jsonrpc` reply.
