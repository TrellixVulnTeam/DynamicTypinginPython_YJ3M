+# Note: this module needs to be made idempotent. Possible solution is to use resource tags with the volumes.
+# if state=present and it doesn't exist, create, tag and attach. 
+# Check for state by looking for volume attachment with tag (and against block device mapping?).
+# Would personally like to revisit this in May when Eucalyptus also has tagging support (3.3).
