    Update yaml.py example to include A colon for single host in a group (#51830)
    
    * Update yaml.py exmaple to include A colon
    
    took me some time to find that out, you can have a single host under a group without the A colon, but if you add another host also w/o A colon, they will be parsed as a single line.
    
    * Update yaml.py
