 Introduction
 ============
 
-Before we dive into the really fun parts -- playbooks, configuration management, deployment, and orchestration -- we'll learn how to get Ansible installed and cover some basic concepts.  We'll also go over how to execute ad-hoc commands in parallel across your nodes using /usr/bin/ansible, and see what sort of modules are available in Ansible's core (you can also write your own, which is covered later).
