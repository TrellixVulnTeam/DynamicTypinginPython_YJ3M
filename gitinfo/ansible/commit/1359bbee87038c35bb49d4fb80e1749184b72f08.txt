    Fix traceback with using GCE on EL6 with python-crypto2.6
    
    This fix resolves an issue on EL6 systems where there may be multiple versions
    of pycrypto installed.  EPEL provides both `python-crypto` and
    `python-crypto2.6`.  These packages are co-installable.  However, modules
    importing the `Crypto` library must specify which version to use, otherwise the
    default will be used.
    
    This change follows the same pattern established in `bin/ansible` for
    specifying python library requirements.
