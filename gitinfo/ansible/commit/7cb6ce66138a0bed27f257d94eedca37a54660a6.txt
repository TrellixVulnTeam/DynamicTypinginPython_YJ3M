 Some key concepts here include:
 
-   * Everything is expressed in simple YAML
-   * Steps can be run as non-root
-   * Modules can notify 'handlers' when changes occur.
-   * Tasks and handlers can be 'included' to faciliate sharing and 'class' like behavior
+   * Everything is expressed in a simple YAML data format, not a custom language, not code.
+   * Playooks can have many steps
+   * Any step can run as any user
+   * Conditional handlers fire on 'notify'.  Ex: restart apache only once, at the end, only if needed
+   * Tasks and handlers can be 'included' to faciliate sharing and reuse
+   * Include statements can take parameters for customization, and be used more than once per file
+   * Variables from the host system (from facter, ohai, etc) bubble-up for use in templates
+   * Variables can be deferenced like {{ varname }} in both include directives & templates
+   * Templates are powered by Jinja2: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#synopsis
