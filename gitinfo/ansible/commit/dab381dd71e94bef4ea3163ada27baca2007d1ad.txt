 If your Ansible inventory fluctuates over time, with hosts spinning up and shutting down in response to business demands, the static inventory solutions described in :ref:`inventory` will not serve your needs. You may need to track hosts from multiple sources: cloud providers, LDAP, `Cobbler <https://cobbler.github.io>`_, and/or enterprise CMDB systems.
 
-Ansible integrates all of these options via a dynamic external inventory system. Ansible supports two ways to connect with external inventory:  :ref:`inventory_plugins` and `inventory scripts <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/contrib/inventory>`.

 Inventory plugins take advantage of the most recent updates to Ansible's core code. We recommend plugins over scripts for dynamic inventory. You can :ref:`write your own plugin <developing_inventory>` to connect to additional dynamic inventory sources.
