+How do I get Ansible to notice a dead target in a timely manner?

+You can add ``-o ServerAliveInterval=NumberOfSeconds`` in ``ssh_args`` from ``ansible.cfg``. Without this option, SSH and therefore Ansible will wait until the TCP connection times out. Another solution is to add ``ServerAliveInterval`` into your global SSH configuration. A good value for ``ServerAliveInterval`` is up to you to decide; keep in mind that ``ServerAliveCountMax=3`` is the SSH default so any value you set will be tripled before terminating the SSH session.
