 Planned work
 ============
 
-See the `Ansible 2.10 Project Board <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/projects/39>`_
+- Migrate non-base plugins and modules from the ``ansible/ansible`` repository to smaller collection repositories
+- Add functionality to ease transition to collections, such as automatic redirects from the 2.9 names to the new FQCN of the plugin
+- Create new ``ansible-base`` package representing the ``ansible/ansible`` repository
+
+Additional Resources
+====================
+
+The 2.10 release of Ansible will fundamentally change the scope of plugins included in the ``ansible/ansible`` repository, by
+moving much of the plugins into smaller collection repositories that will be shipped through https://galaxy.ansible.com/
