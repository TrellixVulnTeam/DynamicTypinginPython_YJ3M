+Merged
+===================
+
+Hi!
+
+This has been merged in, and will also be included in the next major release.
+
+If you or anyone else has any further questions, please let us know by stopping by one of the two mailing lists, as appropriate:
+
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project - for user questions, tips, and tricks
+   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel - for strategy, future planning, and questions about writing code
+
+Because this project is very active, we're unlikely to see comments made on closed tickets, but the mailing list is a great way to ask questions, or post if you don't think this particular
+issue is resolved.
+
+Thank you!
