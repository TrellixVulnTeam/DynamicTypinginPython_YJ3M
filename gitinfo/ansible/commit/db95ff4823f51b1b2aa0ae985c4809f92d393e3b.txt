 notes:
-  - If you are trying to remove an item from an associative array/dictionary,
-    for example a label or an annotation, you will need to explicitly set the
-    value of the item to be removed to `null`. Simply deleting the entry in the
-    dictionary will not remove it from openshift or kubernetes.
