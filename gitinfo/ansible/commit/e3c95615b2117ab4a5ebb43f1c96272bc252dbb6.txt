-     - Unzips compressed files and archives. For extracting any compression types other than .zip, the PowerShellCommunityExtensions (PSCX) Module is required.  This module (in conjunction with PSCX) has the ability to recursively unzip files within the src zip file provided and also functionality for many other compression types. If the destination directory does not exist, it will be created before unzipping the file.  Specifying rm parameter will force removal of the src file after extraction.
