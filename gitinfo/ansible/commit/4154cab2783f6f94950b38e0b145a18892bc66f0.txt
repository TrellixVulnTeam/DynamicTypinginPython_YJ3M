    Updates documentation formatting and dependencies (#45252)
    
    The documentation formatting was a bit incorrect and the dependencies
    mentioned were out of date. This fixes that.

 notes:
   - For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see U(https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5).
   - Requires the f5-sdk Python package on the host. This is as easy as C(pip install f5-sdk).
+  - Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
+  - The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP
+    specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
+    M(bigip_config) module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for
+    the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
 requirements:
-  - f5-sdk >= 3.0.9
+  - f5-sdk >= 3.0.16
