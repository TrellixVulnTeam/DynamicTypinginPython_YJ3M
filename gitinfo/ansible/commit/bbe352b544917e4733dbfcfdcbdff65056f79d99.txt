    Document: OpenStack inventory script needs grizzly
    
    The OpenStack Inventory script uses the OS-EXT-IPS:type parameter
    to distinguish between fixed and floating IP addresses.
    This was only added in the Grizzly release, see
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1117784
    
    Specify in the docs that this inventory script requires Grizzly
    or greater.
