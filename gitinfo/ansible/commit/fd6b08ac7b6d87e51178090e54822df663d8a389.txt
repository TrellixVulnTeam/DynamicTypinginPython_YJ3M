+Possible Misunderstanding
+=========================
+
+Hi!
+
+Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us.
+
+We believe the ticket you have filed is being somewhat misunderstood, as one thing works a little differently than stated.
+
+In particular, we believe you have said:
+
+   * THING ONE
+
+However, however what is happening is that:
+
+   * THING TWO
+
+We would suggest:
+
+   * THING THREE
+
+In the future, this might be a topic more well suited for the user list:

+
+Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
