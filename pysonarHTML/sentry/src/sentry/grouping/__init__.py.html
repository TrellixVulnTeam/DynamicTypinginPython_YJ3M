<span class='lineno'>   2</span> sentry.grouping
<span class='lineno'>   3</span> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<span class='lineno'>   4</span> 
<span class='lineno'>   5</span> This package implements various grouping related functionality in Sentry.
<span class='lineno'>   6</span> It&#39;s an evolution of an earlier grouping system and the backwards compatibility
<span class='lineno'>   7</span> with that grouping system has created a certain amount of complexity.
<span class='lineno'>   8</span> 
<span class='lineno'>   9</span> General Overview
<span class='lineno'>  10</span> ----------------
<span class='lineno'>  11</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  12</span> Events are grouped together into issues by calculating hashes.  When a hash
<span class='lineno'>  13</span> is already associated with a group that group is reused.  The grouping code
<span class='lineno'>  14</span> can however generate more than one hash the sum of which will be added to a
<span class='lineno'>  15</span> group.  In the database this is represented in the `GroupHash` model.
<span class='lineno'>  16</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  17</span> Grouping hashes can be created from different methods.  These are called
<span class='lineno'>  18</span> variants and are implemented in in `sentry.grouping.variants`.  The
<span class='lineno'>  19</span> `get_grouping_variants_for_event` function of the grouping API evaluates all
<span class='lineno'>  20</span> variants that would be available for the event and returns them.
<span class='lineno'>  21</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  22</span> Afterward each variant can produce hashes which are then used for grouping.
<span class='lineno'>  23</span> Some variants (like the component variants) will use the component system
<span class='lineno'>  24</span> to annotate the inputs into the hashing function so that they can be shown
<span class='lineno'>  25</span> to the user.  These values are not persisted, but the configuration inputs are
<span class='lineno'>  26</span> stored in the event.
<span class='lineno'>  27</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  28</span> For reproducibility an event config is persisted in the event dictionary
<span class='lineno'>  29</span> consisting of two main sources of configuration: event enhancers and the
<span class='lineno'>  30</span> version of the grouping config.  Enhancers are custom rules applied to the
<span class='lineno'>  31</span> default grouping algorithm (specifically the stacktrace) and the base version
<span class='lineno'>  32</span> picks one of the many versions of the algorithm.
<span class='lineno'>  33</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  34</span> The default version of the algorithm is selected on a per project basis.
<span class='lineno'>  35</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  36</span> Variants
<span class='lineno'>  37</span> --------
<span class='lineno'>  38</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  39</span> `ChecksumVariant`:
<span class='lineno'>  40</span>     This is the legacy variant of the grouping algorithm.  Clients at one point
<span class='lineno'>  41</span>     in the past were able to provide a grouping hash (the checksum) which was
<span class='lineno'>  42</span>     used for grouping exclusively.
<span class='lineno'>  43</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  44</span> `FallbackVariant`:
<span class='lineno'>  45</span>     This variant produces always the same hash.  It&#39;s used if nothing else works.
<span class='lineno'>  46</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  47</span> `ComponentVariant`:
<span class='lineno'>  48</span>     This is the main variant which uses the underlying component based grouping
<span class='lineno'>  49</span>     strategy system.  It produces hashes but can also expose the component
<span class='lineno'>  50</span>     tree with annotations so users can debug it.
<span class='lineno'>  51</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  52</span> `CustomFingerprintVariant`:
<span class='lineno'>  53</span>     This variant is similar to the checksum variant but instead produces
<span class='lineno'>  54</span>     fingerprint values which are then hashed.  This can be used both for
<span class='lineno'>  55</span>     events produced by the server as well as events which are fingerprinted
<span class='lineno'>  56</span>     by the SDK.  If the special `{{ default }}` value is used then this
<span class='lineno'>  57</span>     variant is not used.
<span class='lineno'>  58</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  59</span> `SaltedComponentVariant`:
<span class='lineno'>  60</span>     This variant is used when the server or client produce a fingerprint
<span class='lineno'>  61</span>     that refers with the special `{{ default }}` value to the default
<span class='lineno'>  62</span>     grouping algorithm and the default grouping algorithm uses the
<span class='lineno'>  63</span>     component based grouping system.
<span class='lineno'>  64</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  65</span> Component Based Grouping
<span class='lineno'>  66</span> ------------------------
<span class='lineno'>  67</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  68</span> The component based grouping system produces a tree of nodes (referred to
<span class='lineno'>  69</span> as component) to produce the hash.  These are defined in
<span class='lineno'>  70</span> `sentry.grouping.component`.  A component has an `id` which is a string
<span class='lineno'>  71</span> identifying the component in the tree.  This `id` is not unique in the tree
<span class='lineno'>  72</span> but unique on one level of the hierarchy.  It has an optional `hint` which is
<span class='lineno'>  73</span> a string that carries information for the user about why a value was used, not
<span class='lineno'>  74</span> used or why it might have been modified.  Additionally it can carry `values`
<span class='lineno'>  75</span> which are either components or primitives (strings or integers).  Lastly a
<span class='lineno'>  76</span> component has a boolean `contributes` flag.  When set to `False` this flag
<span class='lineno'>  77</span> removes a component (and its children) entirely from the grouping output.
<span class='lineno'>  78</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  79</span> Here an example of how components can be used::
<span class='lineno'>  80</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  81</span>     function_name = &#39;lambda$1234&#39;
<span class='lineno'>  82</span>     threads = GroupingComponent(
<span class='lineno'>  83</span>         id=&quot;function&quot;,
<span class='lineno'>  84</span>         values=[function_name],
<span class='lineno'>  85</span>         contributes=False,
<span class='lineno'>  86</span>         hint=&#39;Unused because generated code&#39;
<span class='lineno'>  87</span>     )
<span class='lineno'>  88</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  89</span> Strategies and Strategy Configurations
<span class='lineno'>  90</span> --------------------------------------
<span class='lineno'>  91</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  92</span> Component based grouping is triggered by strategies.  Strategies define the
<span class='lineno'>  93</span> logic for how to generate a component for an interface in the event.  Each
<span class='lineno'>  94</span> strategy can only produce a component for one interface.  For instance a
<span class='lineno'>  95</span> stacktrace strategy can produce a component tree for a stacktrace.  Because
<span class='lineno'>  96</span> events can have different forms and different strategies for the same interface
<span class='lineno'>  97</span> strategy configurations define which ones are picked.
<span class='lineno'>  98</span> 
<span class='lineno'>  99</span> So for instance there is a `frame:legacy` strategy which is the legacy
<span class='lineno'> 100</span> version of `frame` strategy.  Then there are the new ones (`frame:v1`,
<span class='lineno'> 101</span> `frame:v2`, etc.).  The strategy configuration defines which one is used.
<span class='lineno'> 102</span> These are in `sentry.grouping.strategies.configurations`.  A strategy can
<span class='lineno'> 103</span> inherit from another one in which case a lot of behavior is inherited unless
<span class='lineno'> 104</span> overridden.
<span class='lineno'> 105</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 106</span> This for instance is how one of the configurations is defined::
<span class='lineno'> 107</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 108</span>     register_strategy_config(
<span class='lineno'> 109</span>         id=&quot;newstyle:2019-10-29&quot;,
<span class='lineno'> 110</span>         base=&quot;newstyle:2019-05-08&quot;,
<span class='lineno'> 111</span>         delegates=[&quot;frame:v4&quot;],
<span class='lineno'> 112</span>         risk=RISK_LEVEL_MEDIUM,
<span class='lineno'> 113</span>         changelog=&quot;...&quot;,
<span class='lineno'> 114</span>     )
<span class='lineno'> 115</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 116</span> The configuration ID (`newstyle:2019-10-29`) is defined in the project
<span class='lineno'> 117</span> options and then becomes the strategy configuration of choice for all new
<span class='lineno'> 118</span> events.  Because in this case it inherits from another one, the default
<span class='lineno'> 119</span> configurations from that strategy are reused.  Here the `frame` is changed
<span class='lineno'> 120</span> to version `v4`.  Additionally a risk level and changelog is defined which
<span class='lineno'> 121</span> the UI uses to guide the user through upgrades.
<span class='lineno'> 122</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 123</span> Note that here the frame is defined as a delegate.  A delegate is a strategy
<span class='lineno'> 124</span> that is used for an interface which by itself is not used for grouping.  This
<span class='lineno'> 125</span> means that just because an event has a frame, the frame strategy does not
<span class='lineno'> 126</span> activate.  Only if another interface recurses down into a frame this strategy
<span class='lineno'> 127</span> will be used.
<span class='lineno'> 128</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 129</span> To add a new configuration just add it to the list.  To make a configuration the default
<span class='lineno'> 130</span> for new projects you also need to bump the project epoch and configure it
<span class='lineno'> 131</span> to be used by default for an epoch in `sentry.projectoptions.defaults`
<span class='lineno'> 132</span> (for the `sentry:grouping_config`) key.
<span class='lineno'> 133</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 134</span> Fingerprinting and Enhancements
<span class='lineno'> 135</span> -------------------------------
<span class='lineno'> 136</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 137</span> Server side fingerprinting and enhancements are also folded into this grouping
<span class='lineno'> 138</span> system.  The former is in `sentry.grouping.fingerprinting` and can fundamentally
<span class='lineno'> 139</span> override the default grouping system.  Enhancements are used by the stacktrace
<span class='lineno'> 140</span> strategies to improve how stacktraces are used for grouping.  Enhancements
<span class='lineno'> 141</span> activate in two places: as part of stacktrace normalization to update the
<span class='lineno'> 142</span> `in-app` flag and later on grouping by the stacktrace strategy to add or remove
<span class='lineno'> 143</span> frames from the grouping algorithm.
<span class='lineno'> 144</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 145</span> Testing
<span class='lineno'> 146</span> -------
<span class='lineno'> 147</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 148</span> Tests for grouping are in `tests/sentry/grouping`.  They are snapshot based
<span class='lineno'> 149</span> and snapshots exist for all tests and all versions of the grouping algorithm.
<span class='lineno'> 150</span> If you add a new one copy the folder in the snapshot directory over to match
<span class='lineno'> 151</span> the new name which makes it easier to evaluate differences.
